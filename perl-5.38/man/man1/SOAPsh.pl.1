.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
SOAPsh.pl is a shell for making SOAP calls. It takes two parameters:
mandatory endpoint and optional uri (actually it will tell you about it
if you try to run it). Additional commands can follow.
.PP
After that you'll be able to run any methods of SOAP::Lite, like autotype,
readable, encoding, etc. You can run it the same way as you do it in
your Perl script. You'll see output from method, result of SOAP call,
detailed info on SOAP faulure or transport error.
.PP
For full list of available methods see documentation for SOAP::Lite.
.PP
Along with methods of SOAP::Lite you'll be able (and that's much more
interesting) run any SOAP methods you know about on remote server and
see processed results. You can even switch on debugging (with call
something like: \f(CWon_debug(sub{print@_})\fR) and see SOAP code with
headers sent and received.
