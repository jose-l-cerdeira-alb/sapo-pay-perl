.SH NAME
Net::Telnet \- interact with TELNET port or other TCP ports
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`use Net::Telnet ();\*(C'\fR
.PP
see METHODS or EXAMPLES sections below
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do
network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol.  Simple
I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are provided.  More
sophisticated interactive features are provided because connecting to
a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a program designed
for human interaction.  These interactive features include the ability
to specify a time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input
stream, such as the prompt from a shell.  IPv6 support is available
when using perl 5.14 or later, see \f(CWfamily()\fR.
.PP
Other reasons to use this module than strictly with a TELNET port are:
.IP \(bu 2
You're not familiar with sockets and you want a simple way to make
client connections to TCP services.
.IP \(bu 2
You want to be able to specify your own time-out while connecting,
reading, or writing.
.IP \(bu 2
You're communicating with an interactive program at the other end of
some socket or pipe and you want to wait for certain patterns to
appear.
.PP
Here's an example that prints who's logged-on to a remote host.  In
addition to a username and password, you must also know the user's
shell prompt, which for this example is \f(CW"bash$ "\fR
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    use Net::Telnet ();
\&    $t = new Net::Telnet (Timeout => 10,
\&                          Prompt => \*(Aq/bash\e$ $/\*(Aq);
\&    $t\->open($host);
\&    $t\->login($username, $passwd);
\&    @lines = $t\->cmd("who");
\&    print @lines;

Usage questions should be directed to the perlmonks.org discussion
group.  Bugs can be viewed or reported at cpan.org on the Net::Telnet
page.
.SS "What To Know Before Using"
.IX Subsection "What To Know Before Using"
.IP \(bu 2
All output is flushed while all input is buffered.  Each object
contains its own input buffer.
.IP \(bu 2
The output record separator for \f(CWprint()\fR and \f(CWcmd()\fR is set to
\&\f(CW"\en"\fR by default, so that you don't have to append all your commands
with a newline.  To avoid printing a trailing \f(CW"\en"\fR use \f(CWput()\fR or
set the \fIoutput_record_separator\fR to \f(CW""\fR.
.IP \(bu 2
The methods \f(CWlogin()\fR and \f(CWcmd()\fR use the \fIprompt\fR setting in the
object to determine when a login or remote command is complete.  Those
methods will fail with a time-out if you don't set the prompt
correctly.
.IP \(bu 2
Use a combination of \f(CWprint()\fR and \f(CWwaitfor()\fR as an alternative to
\&\f(CWlogin()\fR or \f(CWcmd()\fR when they don't do what you want.
.IP \(bu 2
Errors such as timing-out are handled according to the error mode
action.  The default action is to print an error message to standard
error and have the program die.  See the \f(CWerrmode()\fR method for more
information.
.IP \(bu 2
When constructing the match operator argument for \f(CWprompt()\fR or
\&\f(CWwaitfor()\fR, always use single quotes instead of double quotes to
avoid unexpected backslash interpretation (e.g. \f(CW\*(Aq/bash\e$ $/\*(Aq\fR).  If
you're constructing a DOS like file path, you'll need to use four
backslashes to represent one (e.g. \f(CW\*(Aq/c:\e\e\e\eusers\e\e\e\ebill>$/i\*(Aq\fR).
.Sp
Of course don't forget about regexp metacharacters like \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR.  You'll only need a single backslash to quote them.  The anchor
metacharacters \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR refer to positions in the input buffer.
To avoid matching characters read that look like a prompt, it's a good
idea to end your prompt pattern with the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR anchor.  That way the
prompt will only match if it's the last thing read.
.IP \(bu 2
In the input stream, each sequence of \fIcarriage return\fR and \fIline
feed\fR (i.e. \f(CW"\e015\e012"\fR or CR LF) is converted to \f(CW"\en"\fR.  In the
output stream, each occurrence of \f(CW"\en"\fR is converted to a sequence
of CR LF.  See \f(CWbinmode()\fR to change the behavior.  TCP protocols
typically use the ASCII sequence, carriage return and line feed to
designate a newline.
.IP \(bu 2
Timing-out while making a connection is disabled for machines that
don't support the \f(CWalarm()\fR function.  Most notably these include
MS-Windows machines.
.IP \(bu 2
You'll need to be running at least Perl version 5.002 to use this
module.  This module does not require any libraries that don't already
come with a standard Perl distribution.
.Sp
If you have the IO:: libraries installed (they come standard with
perl5.004 and later) then IO::Socket::INET is used as a base class,
otherwise FileHandle is used.
.SS Debugging
.IX Subsection "Debugging"
The typical usage bug causes a time-out error because you've made
incorrect assumptions about what the remote side actually sends.  The
easiest way to reconcile what the remote side sends with your
expectations is to use \f(CWinput_log()\fR or \f(CWdump_log()\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CWdump_log()\fR allows you to see the data being sent from the remote
side before any translation is done, while \f(CWinput_log()\fR shows you
the results after translation.  The translation includes converting
end of line characters, removing and responding to TELNET protocol
commands in the data stream.
.SS "Style of Named Parameters"
.IX Subsection "Style of Named Parameters"
Two different styles of named parameters are supported.  This document
only shows the IO:: style:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Net::Telnet\->new(Timeout => 20);
.Ve
.PP
however the dash-option style is also allowed:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Net::Telnet\->new(\-timeout => 20);
.Ve
.SS "Connecting to a Remote MS-Windows Machine"
.IX Subsection "Connecting to a Remote MS-Windows Machine"
By default MS-Windows doesn't come with a TELNET server.  However
third party TELNET servers are available.  Unfortunately many of these
servers falsely claim to be a TELNET server.  This is especially true
of the so-called "Microsoft Telnet Server" that comes installed with
some newer versions MS-Windows.
.PP
When a TELNET server first accepts a connection, it must use the ASCII
control characters carriage-return and line-feed to start a new line
(see RFC854).  A server like the "Microsoft Telnet Server" that
doesn't do this, isn't a TELNET server.  These servers send ANSI
terminal escape sequences to position to a column on a subsequent line
and to even position while writing characters that are adjacent to
each other.  Worse, when sending output these servers resend
previously sent command output in a misguided attempt to display an
entire terminal screen.
.PP
Connecting Net::Telnet to one of these false TELNET servers makes your
job of parsing command output very difficult.  It's better to replace
a false TELNET server with a real TELNET server.  The better TELNET
servers for MS-Windows allow you to avoid the ANSI escapes by turning
off something some of them call \fIconsole mode\fR.

.Sp
This method sends the command \fR\f(CI$string\fR\fI\fR, and reads the characters
sent back by the command up until and including the matching prompt.
It's assumed that the program to which you're sending is some kind of
command prompting interpreter such as a shell.
.Sp
The command \fR\f(CI$string\fR\fI\fR is automatically appended with the
output_record_separator, by default it is \f(CW"\en"\fR.  This is similar
to someone typing a command and hitting the return key.  Set the
output_record_separator to change this behavior.
.Sp
In a scalar context, the characters read from the remote side are
discarded and \f(CW1\fR is returned on success.  On time-out, eof, or other
failures, the error mode action is performed.  See \f(CWerrmode()\fR.
.Sp
In a list context, just the output generated by the command is
returned, one line per element.  In other words, all the characters in
between the echoed back command string and the prompt are returned.
If the command happens to return no output, a list containing one
element, the empty string is returned.  This is so the list will
indicate true in a boolean context.  On time-out, eof, or other
failures, the error mode action is performed.  See \f(CWerrmode()\fR.
.Sp
The characters that matched the prompt may be retrieved using
\&\f(CWlast_prompt()\fR.
.Sp
Many command interpreters echo back the command sent.  In most
situations, this method removes the first line returned from the
remote side (i.e. the echoed back command).  See \f(CWcmd_remove_mode()\fR
for more control over this feature.
.Sp
Use \f(CWdump_log()\fR to debug when this method keeps timing-out and you
don't think it should.
.Sp
Consider using a combination of \f(CWprint()\fR and \f(CWwaitfor()\fR as an
alternative to this method when it doesn't do what you want, e.g. the
command you send prompts for input.
.Sp
The \fIOutput\fR named parameter provides an alternative method of
receiving command output.  If you pass a scalar reference, all the
output (even if it contains multiple lines) is returned in the
referenced scalar.  If you pass an array or hash reference, the lines
of output are returned in the referenced array or hash.  You can use
\&\f(CWinput_record_separator()\fR to change the notion of what separates a
line.
.Sp
Optional named parameters are provided to override the current
settings of cmd_remove_mode, errmode, input_record_separator, ors,
output_record_separator, prompt, rs, and timeout.  Rs is synonymous
with input_record_separator and ors is synonymous with
output_record_separator.

.Sp
This method controls how to deal with echoed back commands in the
output returned by \fBcmd()\fR.  Typically, when you send a command to the
remote side, the first line of output returned is the command echoed
back.  Use this mode to remove the first line of output normally
returned by \fBcmd()\fR.
.Sp
If no argument is given, the current mode is returned.
.Sp
If \fR\f(CI$mode\fR\fI\fR is \f(CW0\fR then the command output returned from \fBcmd()\fR has no
lines removed.  If \fI\fR\f(CI$mode\fR\fI\fR is a positive integer, then the first
\&\fI\fR\f(CI$mode\fR\fI\fR lines of command output are stripped.
.Sp
By default, \fR\f(CI$mode\fR\fI\fR is set to \f(CW"auto"\fR.  Auto means that whether or
not the first line of command output is stripped, depends on whether
or not the remote side offered to echo.  By default, Net::Telnet
always accepts an offer to echo by the remote side.  You can change
the default to reject such an offer using \f(CWoption_accept()\fR.

To stop logging, use an empty string as an argument.  The stopped
filehandle is not closed.

If an open filehandle is given, it is used for logging and returned.
Otherwise, the argument is assumed to be the name of a file, the
filename is opened for logging and a filehandle to it is returned.  If
the filehandle is not already opened or the filename can't be opened

using the object.  The first calling sequence returns the current
error mode.  The second calling sequence sets it to \fR\f(CI$mode\fR\fI\fR and
returns the previous mode.  Valid values for \fI\fR\f(CI$mode\fR\fI\fR are \f(CW"die"\fR
(the default), \f(CW"return"\fR, a \fIcoderef\fR, or an \fIarrayref\fR.
.Sp
When mode is \f(CW"die"\fR and an error is encountered using the object,
then an error message is printed to standard error and the program
dies.
.Sp
When mode is \f(CW"return"\fR then the method generating the error places
an error message in the object and returns an undefined value in a
scalar context and an empty list in list context.  The error message
may be obtained using \f(CWerrmsg()\fR.
.Sp
When mode is a \fIcoderef\fR, then when an error is encountered
\&\fIcoderef\fR is called with the error message as its first argument.
Using this mode you may have your own subroutine handle errors.  If
\&\fIcoderef\fR itself returns then the method generating the error returns
undefined or an empty list depending on context.
.Sp
When mode is an \fIarrayref\fR, the first element of the array must be a
\&\fIcoderef\fR.  Any elements that follow are the arguments to \fIcoderef\fR.
When an error is encountered, the \fIcoderef\fR is called with its
arguments.  Using this mode you may have your own subroutine handle
errors.  If the \fIcoderef\fR itself returns then the method generating
the error returns undefined or an empty list depending on context.
.Sp
A warning is printed to STDERR when attempting to set this attribute
to something that is not \f(CW"die"\fR, \f(CW"return"\fR, a \fIcoderef\fR, or an
\&\fIarrayref\fR whose first element isn't a \fIcoderef\fR.

The first calling sequence returns the error message associated with
the object.  The empty string is returned if no error has been
encountered yet.  The second calling sequence sets the error message
for the object to the concatenation of \fR\f(CI@msgs\fR\fI\fR and returns the
previous error message.  Normally, error messages are set internally
by a method when an error is encountered.

.Sp
This method designates which IP address family \f(CWhost()\fR refers to,
i.e. IPv4 or IPv6.  IPv6 support is available when using perl 5.14 or
later.  With no argument it returns the current value set in the
object.  With an argument it sets the current address family to
\&\fR\f(CI$family\fR\fI\fR and returns the previous address family.  Valid values are
\&\f(CW"ipv4"\fR, \f(CW"ipv6"\fR, or \f(CW"any"\fR.  When \f(CW"any"\fR, the \f(CWhost()\fR can
be a hostname or IP address for either IPv4 or IPv6.  After
connecting, you can use \f(CWsockfamily()\fR to determine which IP address
family was used.
.Sp
The default value is \f(CW"ipv4"\fR.
.Sp
The error mode action is performed when attempting to set this
attribute to something that isn't \f(CW"ipv4"\fR, \f(CW"ipv6"\fR, or \f(CW"any"\fR.

Suppose you want to use the features of this module to do I/O to
something other than a TCP port, for example STDIN or a filehandle
opened to read from a process.  Instead of opening the object for I/O
to a TCP port by using \f(CWopen()\fR or \f(CWnew()\fR, call this method

A timeout may be expressed as a relative or absolute value.  If

If \fR\f(CI$secs\fR\fI\fR is \f(CW0\fR then time-out occurs if the data cannot be

You can also use Net::Telnet to interact with local programs.  This
example changes a user's login password.  It introduces the \f(CWspawn()\fR
subroutine to start a program and associate a filehandle with its
standard I/O.  Because the passwd program always prompts for passwords
on its controlling terminal, the IO::Pty module is used to create a
new pseudo terminal for use by passwd.  The Net::Telnet object reads
and writes to that pseudo terminal.  To use the code below, substitute
"changeme" with the actual old and new passwords.

Here is an example that uses the openssh program to connect to a
remote host.  It uses the \f(CWspawn()\fR subroutine, from the password
changing example above, to start the ssh program and then read and
write to it via a Net::Telnet object.  This example turns off ssh host
key checking, which reduces your ability to know when someone on the
network is impersonating the remote host.  To use the code below,
substitute "changeme" with the actual host, user, password, and
command prompt.
