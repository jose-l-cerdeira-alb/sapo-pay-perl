.SH NAME
XML::Filter::BufferText \- Filter to put all characters() in one event
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 4
\&  my $h = SomeHandler\->new;
\&  my $f = XML::Filter::BufferText\->new( Handler => $h );
\&  my $p = SomeParser\->new( Handler => $f );
\&  $p\->parse;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a very simple filter. One common cause of grief (and programmer
error) is that XML parsers aren't required to provide character events in one
chunk. They can, but are not forced to, and most don't. This filter does the
trivial but oft-repeated task of putting all characters into a single event.
.PP
Note that this won't help you cases such as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  <foo> blah <!\-\- comment \-\-> phubar </foo>
.Ve
.PP
In the above case, given the interleaving comment, there will be two
\&\f(CWcharacter()\fR events. This may be worked around in the future if there is
demand for it.
.PP
An interesting way to use this filter, instead of telling users to use it,
is to return it from your handler's constructor, already configured and all.
That'll make the buffering totally transparent to them (\f(CW\*(C`XML::SAX::Writer\*(C'\fR
does that).
