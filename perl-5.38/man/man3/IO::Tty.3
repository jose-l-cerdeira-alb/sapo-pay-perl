.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR is used internally by \f(CW\*(C`IO::Pty\*(C'\fR to create a pseudo-tty.
You wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants, use
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Pty\*(C'\fR.  For a list of importable constants, see
IO::Tty::Constant.
.PP
Windows is now supported, but ONLY under the Cygwin
environment, see <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.
.PP
Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.  From my
experience, any modern POSIX system should be fine.  Find below a list
of systems that \f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR should work on.  A more detailed table
(which is slowly getting out-of-date) is available from the project
pages document manager at SourceForge
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/>.
.PP
If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in the
"verified" list, you probably have some non-standard setup, e.g. you
compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!).
Please ask your friendly sysadmin for help.
.PP
If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of \f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR,
do a \f(CW\*(Aqperl Makefile.PL; make; make test; uname \-a\*(Aq\fR and send me
(\fIRGiersig@cpan.org\fR) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from
that.  There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...
.PP
If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname \-a' and 'perl \-V'
is a good start; also, the output from "perl Makefile.PL" contains a
lot of interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get
an overview.  Thanks!
.SH "VERIFIED SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES"
.IX Header "VERIFIED SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES"
This is a list of systems that \f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR seems to work on ('make
test' passes) with comments about "features":
.IP \(bu 4
AIX 4.3
.Sp
Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.
.IP \(bu 4
AIX 5.x
.IP \(bu 4
FreeBSD 4.4
.Sp
EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP \(bu 4
OpenBSD 2.8
.Sp
The ioctl TIOCSCTTY sometimes fails.  This is also known in
Tcl/Expect, see http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html
.Sp
EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP \(bu 4
Darwin 7.9.0
.IP \(bu 4
HPUX 10.20 & 11.00
.Sp
EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP \(bu 4
IRIX 6.5
.IP \(bu 4
Linux 2.2.x & 2.4.x
.Sp
Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.
.IP \(bu 4
OSF 4.0
.Sp
EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP \(bu 4
Solaris 8, 2.7, 2.6
.Sp
Has the "feature" of returning EOF just once?!
.Sp
EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP \(bu 4
Windows NT/2k/XP (under Cygwin)
.Sp
When you send (print) a too long line (>160 chars) to a non-raw pty,
the call just hangs forever and even \fBalarm()\fR cannot get you out.
Don't complain to me...
.Sp
EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP \(bu 4
z/OS
.PP
The following systems have not been verified yet for this version, but
a previous version worked on them:
.IP \(bu 4
SCO Unix
.IP \(bu 4
NetBSD
.Sp
probably the same as the other *BSDs...
