.SH NAME
Math::Random::Secure::RNG \- The underlying PRNG, as an object.
.SH VERSION
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.080001
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 3
\& use Math::Random::Secure::RNG;
\& my $rng = Math::Random::Secure::RNG\->new();
\& my $int = $rng\->irand();

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This represents a random number generator, as an object.
.PP
Generally, you shouldn't have to worry about this, and you should just use
Math::Random::Secure. But if for some reason you want to modify how the
random number generator works or you want an object-oriented interface
to a random-number generator, you can use this.
.SH METHODS
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS irand
.IX Subsection "irand"
Generates a random unsigned 32\-bit integer.
.SS rand
.IX Subsection "rand"
Generates a random floating-point number greater than or equal to 0
and less than 1.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
These are all options that can be passed to \f(CWnew()\fR or called as methods
on an existing object.
.SS rng
.IX Subsection "rng"
The underlying random number generator. Defaults to an instance of
Math::Random::ISAAC.
.SS seed
.IX Subsection "seed"
The random data used to seed "rng", as a string of bytes. This should
be large enough to properly seed "rng". This means \fIminimally\fR, it
should be 8 bytes (64 bits) and more ideally, 32 bytes (256 bits) or 64
bytes (512 bits). For an idea of how large your seed should be, see
<http://burtleburtle.net/bob/crypto/magnitude.html#brute> for information
on how long it would take to brute-force seeds of each size.
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`seed\*(C'\fR should not be an integer, but a \fBstring of bytes\fR.
.PP
It is very important that the seed be large enough, and also that the seed
be very random. \fBThere are serious attacks possible against random number
generators that are seeded with non-random data or with insufficient random
data.\fR
.PP
By default, we use a 512\-bit (64 byte) seed. If
Moore's Law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law> continues to hold
true, it will be approximately 1000 years before computers can brute-force a
512\-bit (64 byte) seed at any reasonable speed (and physics suggests that
computers will never actually become that fast, although there could always
be improvements or new methods of computing we can't now imagine, possibly
making Moore's Law continue to hold true forever).
.PP
If you pass this to \f(CWnew()\fR, "seeder" and "seed_size" will be ignored.
.SS seeder
.IX Subsection "seeder"
An instance of Crypt::Random::Source::Base that will be used to
get the seed for "rng".
.SS seed_size
.IX Subsection "seed_size"
How much data (in bytes) should be read using "seeder" to seed "rng".
Defaults to 64 bytes (which is 512 bits).
.PP
See "seed" for more info about what is a reasonable seed size.
