.SH NAME
Dancer::Logger \- common interface for logging in Dancer
.SH VERSION
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 1.3521
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module is the wrapper that provides support for different 
logger engines.
.SH USAGE
.IX Header "USAGE"
.SS "Default engine"
.IX Subsection "Default engine"
The setting \fBlogger\fR defines which logger engine to use. 
If this setting is not set, logging will not be available in the application
code.
.PP
Dancer comes with the logger engines Dancer::Logger::File and
Dancer::Logger::Console, but more are available on the CPAN.
.SS Configuration
.IX Subsection "Configuration"
The \fBlogger\fR configuration variable tells Dancer which engine to use.
.PP
You can change it either in your config.yml file:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # logging to console
\&    logger: "console"
.Ve
.PP
Or in the application code:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # logging to file 
\&    set logger => \*(Aqfile\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
The log format can also be configured, 
please see "logger_format" in Dancer::Logger::Abstract for details.
.SS Auto-serializing
.IX Subsection "Auto-serializing"
The loggers allow auto-serializing of all inputs:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    debug( \*(AqUser credentials: \*(Aq, \e%creds );
.Ve
.PP
Will provide you with an output in a single log message of the string and the
reference dump.
