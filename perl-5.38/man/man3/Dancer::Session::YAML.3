.SH NAME
Dancer::Session::YAML \- YAML\-file\-based session backend for Dancer
.SH VERSION
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 1.3521
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module implements a session engine based on YAML files. Session are stored
in a \fIsession_dir\fR as YAML files. The idea behind this module was to provide a
transparent session storage for the developer.
.PP
This backend is intended to be used in development environments, when looking
inside a session can be useful.
.PP
It's not recommended to use this session engine in production environments.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
The setting \fBsession\fR should be set to \f(CW\*(C`YAML\*(C'\fR in order to use this session
engine in a Dancer application.
.PP
Files will be stored to the value of the setting \f(CW\*(C`session_dir\*(C'\fR, whose default 
value is \f(CW\*(C`appdir/sessions\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Here is an example configuration that use this session engine and stores session
files in /tmp/dancer\-sessions
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    session: "YAML"
\&    session_dir: "/tmp/dancer\-sessions"

.SH METHODS
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS reset
.IX Subsection "reset"
To avoid checking if the sessions directory exists every time a new session is
created, this module maintains a cache of session directories it has already
created. \f(CW\*(C`reset\*(C'\fR wipes this cache out, forcing a test for existence
of the sessions directory next time a session is created. It takes no argument.
.PP
This is particularly useful if you want to remove the sessions directory on the
system where your app is running, but you want this session engine to continue
to work without having to restart your application.
.SH DEPENDENCY
.IX Header "DEPENDENCY"
This module depends on YAML.
