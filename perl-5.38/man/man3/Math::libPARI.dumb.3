libPARI \- Functions and Operations Available in PARI and GP
.PP

The functions and operators available in PARI and in the GP/PARI calculator
are numerous and everexpanding. Here is a description of the ones available
in version 2.3.5. It should be noted that many of these functions accept
quite different types as arguments, but others are more restricted. The list
of acceptable types will be given for each function or class of functions.
Except when stated otherwise, it is understood that a function or operation
which should make natural sense is legal. In this chapter, we will describe
the functions according to a rough classification. The general entry looks
something like:
.IX Xref "Label se:functions"
.PP
foo"(x,{"flag" = 0})": short description.
.PP
The library syntax is foo"(x,"flag")".
.IX Xref "foo"
.PP
This means that the GP function "foo" has one mandatory argument "x", and
an optional one, flag, whose default value is 0. (The "{}" should not be
typed, it is just a convenient notation we will use throughout to denote
optional arguments.) That is, you can type "foo(x,2)", or "foo(x)",
which is then understood to mean "foo(x,0)". As well, a comma or closing
parenthesis, where an optional argument should have been, signals to GP it
should use the default. Thus, the syntax "foo(x,)" is also accepted as a
synonym for our last expression. When a function has more than one optional
argument, the argument list is filled with user supplied values, in order.
When none are left, the defaults are used instead. Thus, assuming that
"foo"'s prototype had been
.PP
\ \ 
foo"({x = 1},{y = 2},{z = 3}),
"
.PP
typing in "foo(6,4)" would give
you "foo(6,4,3)". In the rare case when you want to set some far away
argument, and leave the defaults in between as they stand, you can use the
``empty arg'' trick alluded to above: "foo(6,,1)" would yield
"foo(6,2,1)". By the way, "foo()" by itself yields
"foo(1,2,3)" as was to be expected.
.PP
In this rather special case of a function having no mandatory argument, you
can even omit the "()": a standalone "foo" would be enough (though we
do not recommend it for your scripts, for the sake of clarity). In defining
GP syntax, we strove to put optional arguments at the end of the argument
list (of course, since they would not make sense otherwise), and in order of
decreasing usefulness so that, most of the time, you will be able to ignore
them.
.PP
Finally, an optional argument (between braces) followed by a star, like
"{"x"}*", means that any number of such arguments (possibly none) can
be given. This is in particular used by the various "print" routines.
.PP
Flags.. A flag is an argument which, rather than conveying
actual information to the routine, intructs it to change its default
behaviour, e.g.\ return more or less information. All such
flags are optional, and will be called flag in the function descriptions to
follow. There are two different kind of flags
.IX Xref "flag"
.PP
* generic: all valid values for the flag are individually
described (``If flag is equal to "1", then...'').
.PP
* binary: use customary binary notation as a
compact way to represent many toggles with just one integer. Let
"(p_0,...,p_n)" be a list of switches (i.e.\ of properties which take either
the value "0" or\ "1"), the number "2^3 + 2^5 = 40" means that "p_3" and "p_5"
are set (that is, set to "1"), and none of the others are (that is, they
are set to "0"). This is announced as ``The binary digits of flag mean 1:
"p_0", 2: "p_1", 4: "p_2"'', and so on, using the available consecutive
powers of\ "2".
.IX Xref "binary flag"
.PP
Mnemonics for flags.. Numeric flags as mentionned above are
obscure, error\-prone, and quite rigid: should the authors
want to adopt a new flag numbering scheme (for instance when noticing
flags with the same meaning but different numeric values across a set of
routines), it would break backward compatibility. The only advantage of
explicit numeric values is that they are fast to type, so their use is only
advised when using the calculator "gp".
.PP
As an alternative, one can replace a numeric flag by a character string
containing symbolic identifiers. For a generic flag, the mnemonic
corresponding to the numeric identifier is given after it as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  fun(x, {flag = 0} ):
\&
\&    If flag is equal to 1 = AGM, use an agm formula\edots
.Ve
.PP
which means that one can use indifferently \f(CW\*(C`fun(x, 1)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`fun(x,
AGM)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For a binary flag, mnemonics corresponding to the various toggles are given
after each of them. They can be negated by prepending \f(CW\*(C`no_\*(C'\fR to the
mnemonic, or by removing such a prefix. These toggles are grouped together
using any punctuation character (such as \f(CW\*(Aq,\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW\*(Aq;\*(Aq\fR). For instance (taken
from description of \f(CW\*(C`ploth(X = a,b,\*(C'\fR\fIexpr\fR\f(CW\*(C`,{\*(C'\fR\fIflag\fR\f(CW\*(C` = 0},{n = 0})\*(C'\fR)
.IX Xref "ploth"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Binary digits of flags mean: C<1 = Parametric>,
\&    C<2 = Recursive>,...
.Ve
.PP
so that, instead of \f(CW1\fR, one could use the mnemonic
\&\f(CW"Parametric; no_Recursive"\fR, or simply \f(CW"Parametric"\fR since
\&\f(CW\*(C`Recursive\*(C'\fR is unset by default (default value of \fIflag\fR is \f(CW0\fR,
i.e.\ everything unset).
.PP
\&\fBPointers.\fR.\evarsidx{pointer} If a parameter in the function
prototype is prefixed with a & sign, as in
.PP
\&\fBfoo\fR\f(CW\*(C`(x,&e)\*(C'\fR
.PP
it means that, besides the normal return value, the function may
assign a value to \f(CW\*(C`e\*(C'\fR as a side effect. When passing the argument, the &
sign has to be typed in explicitly. As of version \fB2.3.5\fR, this \fIpointer\fR
argument is optional for all documented functions, hence the & will always
appear between brackets as in \f(CW\*(C`Z_issquare\*(C'\fR\f(CW\*(C`(x,{&e})\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "pointer"
.PP
\&\fBAbout library programming.\fR.
the \fIlibrary\fR function \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR, as defined
at the beginning of this section, is seen to have two mandatory arguments,
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR and \fIflag\fR: no PARI mathematical function has been implemented so as to
accept a variable number of arguments, so all arguments are mandatory when
programming with the library (often, variants are provided corresponding to
the various flag values). When not mentioned otherwise, the result and
arguments of a function are assumed implicitly to be of type \f(CW\*(C`GEN\*(C'\fR. Most
other functions return an object of type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR integer in C (see
Chapter\ 4). The variable or parameter names \fIprec\fR and \fIflag\fR always denote
\&\f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR integers.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`entree\*(C'\fR type is used by the library to implement iterators (loops,
sums, integrals, etc.) when a formal variable has to successively assume a
number of values in a given set. When programming with the library, it is
easier and much more efficient to code loops and the like directly. Hence
this type is not documented, although it does appear in a few library
function prototypes below. See "Label se:sums" for more details.

vector/matrices of incompatible sizes, between an intmod and a real
number. Note that because of vector and matrix operations, \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR is not
necessarily commutative. Note also that since multiplication between two
column or two row vectors is not allowed, to obtain the scalar product
of two vectors of the same length, you must multiply a line vector by a
column vector, if necessary by transposing one of the vectors (using
the operator \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR or the function \f(CW\*(C`mattranspose\*(C'\fR, see

The expression \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is the quotient of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR. In addition to the impossibilities for multiplication, note that if
the divisor is a matrix, it must be an invertible square matrix, and in that
case the result is \f(CW\*(C`x*y^{\-1}\*(C'\fR. Furthermore note that the result is as exact
as possible: in particular, division of two integers always gives a rational
number (which may be an integer if the quotient is exact) and \fInot\fR the
Euclidean quotient (see \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR for that), and similarly the
quotient of two polynomials is a rational function in general. To obtain the
approximate real value of the quotient of two integers, add \f(CW0.\fR to the
result; to obtain the approximate \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR\-adic value of the quotient of two
integers, add \f(CWO(p^k)\fR to the result; finally, to obtain the
Taylor series expansion of the quotient of two polynomials, add

The expression \f(CW\*(C`x \ey\*(C'\fR is the Euclidean

\&\f(CWfloor(x/y)\fR if \f(CW\*(C`y > 0\*(C'\fR, and \f(CWceil(x/y)\fR if \f(CW\*(C`y < 0\*(C'\fR and
the division is not exact. Hence the remainder \f(CW\*(C`x \- (x\ey)*y\*(C'\fR

remainder is smallest in absolute value and in case of a tie the quotient

The expression \f(CW\*(C`x % y\*(C'\fR evaluates to the modular
Euclidean remainder of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR, which we now define. If \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is an
integer, this is the smallest non-negative integer congruent to \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR modulo
\&\f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR. If \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is a polynomial, this is the polynomial of smallest degree
congruent to \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR modulo \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR. When \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is a non-integral real number,
\&\f(CW\*(C`x%y\*(C'\fR is defined as \f(CW\*(C`x \- (x\ey)*y\*(C'\fR. This
coincides with the definition for \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR integer if and only if \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is an
integer, but still belongs to \f(CW\*(C`[0, |y|[\*(C'\fR. For instance:

Euclidean remainder (\f(CW\*(C`x \- (x\ey)*y\*(C'\fR), of the division of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR by
\&\f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR. This avoids the need to do two divisions if one needs both the quotient
and the remainder. If \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR is present, and \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR are multivariate
polynomials, divide with respect to the variable \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR.

The expression \f(CW\*(C`x^n\*(C'\fR is powering.
If the exponent is an integer, then exact operations are performed using
binary (left-shift) powering techniques. In particular, in this case \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR
cannot be a vector or matrix unless it is a square matrix (invertible
if the exponent is negative). If \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is a \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR\-adic number, its
precision will increase if \f(CW\*(C`v_p(n) > 0\*(C'\fR. Powering a binary quadratic form
(types \f(CW\*(C`t_QFI\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`t_QFR\*(C'\fR) returns a reduced representative of the
class, provided the input is reduced. In particular, \f(CW\*(C`x^1\*(C'\fR is
identical to \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "powering"
.PP
PARI is able to rewrite the multiplication \f(CW\*(C`x * x\*(C'\fR of two \fIidentical\fR
objects as \f(CW\*(C`x^2\*(C'\fR, or \f(CWsqr(x)\fR. Here, identical means the operands are
two different labels referencing the same chunk of memory; no equality test
is performed. This is no longer true when more than two arguments are
involved.
.PP
If the exponent is not of type integer, this is treated as a transcendental
function (see "Label se:trans"), and in particular has the effect of
componentwise powering on vector or matrices.
.PP
As an exception, if the exponent is a rational number \f(CW\*(C`p/q\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR an
integer modulo a prime or a \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR\-adic number, return a solution \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR of

In library mode, it is in fact usually preferable to use the two basic

\&\f(CW\*(C`x\-y\*(C'\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR must be in \fBR\fR, and \efuns{gequal}{x,y} which can be
applied to any two PARI objects \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR and gives 1 (i.e.\ true) if they are
equal (but not necessarily identical), 0 (i.e.\ false) otherwise. Comparisons
to special constants are implemented and should be used instead of

Note that \f(CWgcmp0(x)\fR tests whether \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is equal to zero, even if \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
not an exact object. To test whether \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is an exact object which is equal to
zero, one must use \efuns{isexactzero}{x}.

Also note that the \f(CW\*(C`gcmp\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`gequal\*(C'\fR functions return a C\-integer,

GP accepts the following synonyms for some of the above functions: since we

operators for bitwise \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR or bitwise \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR (use \f(CW\*(C`bitand\*(C'\fR or

Also, \f(CW\*(C`<> \*(C'\fR is accepted as a synonym for \f(CW\*(C` != \*(C'\fR. On the other hand,
\&\f(CW\*(C` = \*(C'\fR is definitely \fInot\fR a synonym for \f(CW\*(C` == \*(C'\fR since it is the

In case all components are equal up to the smallest length of the operands,
the more complex is considered to be larger. More precisely, the longest is

.SS "components of a PARI object"
.IX Subsection "components of a PARI object"
There are essentially three ways to extract the components from a PARI
object.
.IX Xref "components"
.PP
The first and most general, is the function \efuns{component}{x,n} which
extracts the \f(CW\*(C`n\-th\*(C'\fR\-component of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR. This is to be understood as
follows: every PARI type has one or two initial code words. The
components are counted, starting at 1, after these code words. In particular
if \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is a vector, this is indeed the \f(CW\*(C`n\-th\*(C'\fR\-component of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is a matrix, the \f(CW\*(C`n\-th\*(C'\fR column, if \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is a polynomial, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`n\-th\*(C'\fR coefficient (i.e.\ of degree \f(CW\*(C`n\-1\*(C'\fR), and for power series, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`n\-th\*(C'\fR significant coefficient. The use of the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`component\*(C'\fR implies the knowledge of the structure of the different PARI
types, which can be recalled by typing \f(CW\*(C`\et\*(C'\fR under \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "code words"
.PP
The library syntax is \fBcompo\fR\f(CW\*(C`(x,n)\*(C'\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR is a \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "compo"
.PP
The two other methods are more natural but more restricted. The function
\&\efuns{polcoeff}{x,n} gives the coefficient of degree \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR of the polynomial
or power series \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR, with respect to the main variable of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR (to check
variable ordering, or to change it, use the function \f(CW\*(C`reorder\*(C'\fR, see
"Label se:reorder"). In particular if \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR is less than the valuation of
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR or in the case of a polynomial, greater than the degree, the result is
zero (contrary to \f(CW\*(C`compo\*(C'\fR which would send an error message). If \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
a power series and \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR is greater than the largest significant degree, then
an error message is issued.
.IX Xref "reorder"
.PP
For greater flexibility, vector or matrix types are also accepted for \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR,
and the meaning is then identical with that of \f(CW\*(C`compo\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Finally note that a scalar type is considered by \f(CW\*(C`polcoeff\*(C'\fR as a
polynomial of degree zero.
.PP
The library syntax is \fBtruecoeff\fR\f(CW\*(C`(x,n)\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "truecoeff"
.PP
The third method is specific to vectors or matrices in GP. If \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is a
(row or column) vector, then \f(CW\*(C`x[n]\*(C'\fR represents the \f(CW\*(C`n\-th\*(C'\fR
component of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR, i.e.\ \f(CW\*(C`compo(x,n)\*(C'\fR. It is more natural and shorter to
write. If \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is a matrix, \f(CW\*(C`x[m,n]\*(C'\fR represents the coefficient of
row \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR and column \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR of the matrix, \f(CW\*(C`x[m,]\*(C'\fR represents
the \f(CW\*(C`m\-th\*(C'\fR \fIrow\fR of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`x[,n]\*(C'\fR represents
the \f(CW\*(C`n\-th\*(C'\fR \fIcolumn\fR of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR.

\&\esubsecidx{conj}\f(CW\*(C`(x)\*(C'\fR: conjugate of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR. The meaning of this

real quadratic field. This function has no effect on integers, reals,
intmods, fractions or \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR\-adics. The only forbidden type is polmod
(see \f(CW\*(C`conjvec\*(C'\fR for this).

\&\f(CWdegree(q)\fR containing the complex embeddings of the polmod if \f(CW\*(C`q\*(C'\fR has
integral or rational coefficients, and the conjugates of the polmod if \f(CW\*(C`q\*(C'\fR
has some intmod coefficients. The order is the same as that of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`polroots\*(C'\fR functions. If \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is an integer or a rational number, the
result is\ \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR. If \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is a (row or column) vector, the result is a matrix

For exact types, no change. For \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR a vector or a matrix, the operation

As a general rule, which of course in some cases may have exceptions,
transcendental functions operate in the following way:
.IX Xref "Label se:trans"
.PP
\&\fB*\fR If the argument is either an integer, a real, a rational, a complex
or a quadratic number, it is, if necessary, first converted to a real (or
complex) number using the current precision held in the default

inexact arguments such as reals are not.
.IX Xref "precision"
.PP
In GP this is transparent to the user, but when programming in library
mode, care must be taken to supply a meaningful parameter \fIprec\fR as the
last argument of the function if the first argument is an exact object.
This parameter is ignored if the argument is inexact.
.PP
Note that in library mode the precision argument \fIprec\fR is a word
count including codewords, i.e.\ represents the length in words of a real
number, while under \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR the precision (which is changed by the metacommand
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep\*(C'\fR or using \f(CW\*(C`default(realprecision,...)\*(C'\fR) is the number of significant
decimal digits.
.PP
Note that some accuracies attainable on 32\-bit machines cannot be attained
on 64\-bit machines for parity reasons. For example the default \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR accuracy
is 28 decimal digits on 32\-bit machines, corresponding to \fIprec\fR having
the value 5, but this cannot be attained on 64\-bit machines.
.PP
After possible conversion, the function is computed. Note that even if the
argument is real, the result may be complex (e.g.\ \f(CWacos(2.0)\fR or
\&\f(CWacosh(0.0)\fR). Note also that the principal branch is always chosen.
.PP
\&\fB*\fR If the argument is an intmod or a \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR\-adic, at present only a

\&\f(CW\*(C`agm\*(C'\fR (arithmetic-geometric mean) are implemented.
.PP
Note that in the case of a \f(CW2\fR\-adic number, \f(CWsqr(x)\fR may not be
identical to \f(CW\*(C`x*x\*(C'\fR: for example if \f(CW\*(C`x = 1+O(2^5)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`y = 1+O(2^5)\*(C'\fR then
\&\f(CW\*(C`x*y = 1+O(2^5)\*(C'\fR while \f(CW\*(C`sqr(x) = 1+O(2^6)\*(C'\fR. Here, \f(CW\*(C`x * x\*(C'\fR yields the
same result as \f(CWsqr(x)\fR since the two operands are known to be
\&\fIidentical\fR. The same statement holds true for \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR\-adics raised to the
power \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`v_p(n) > 0\*(C'\fR.

\&\fBRemark:.\fR note that if we wanted to be strictly consistent with
the PARI philosophy, we should have \f(CW\*(C`x*y = (4 mod 8)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`sqr(x) = 
(4 mod 32)\*(C'\fR when both \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR are congruent to \f(CW2\fR modulo \f(CW4\fR.
However, since intmod is an exact object, PARI assumes that the modulus
must not change, and the result is hence \f(CW\*(C`(0 mod 4)\*(C'\fR in both cases. On
the other hand, \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR\-adics are not exact objects, hence are treated
differently.
.PP

it is, if necessary, first converted to a power series using the current
precision held in the variable \f(CW\*(C`precdl\*(C'\fR. Under \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR this again is
transparent to the user. When programming in library mode, however, the
global variable \f(CW\*(C`precdl\*(C'\fR must be set before calling the function if the
argument has an exact type (i.e.\ not a power series). Here \f(CW\*(C`precdl\*(C'\fR is
not an argument of the function, but a global variable.

Then the Taylor series expansion of the function around \f(CW\*(C`X = 0\*(C'\fR (where \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR is

Some functions, in particular those relative to height computations (see
\&\f(CW\*(C`ellheight\*(C'\fR) require also that the curve be in minimal Weierstrass
form, which is duly stressed in their description below. This is achieved by
the function \f(CW\*(C`ellminimalmodel\*(C'\fR. \fIUsing a non-minimal model in such a

All functions related to elliptic curves share the prefix \f(CW\*(C`ell\*(C'\fR, and the
precise curve we are interested in is always the first argument, in either
one of the three formats discussed above, unless otherwise specified. The
requirements are given as the \fIminimal\fR ones: any richer structure may
replace the ones requested. For instance, in functions which have no use for
the extra information given by an \fIell\fR structure, the curve can be given
either as a five-component vector, as an \fIsell\fR, or as an \fIell\fR;
if an \fIsell\fR is requested, an \fIell\fR may equally be given.

A finite abelian group \f(CW\*(C`G\*(C'\fR in user-readable format is given by its Smith
Normal Form as a pair \f(CW\*(C`[h,d]\*(C'\fR or triple \f(CW\*(C`[h,d,g]\*(C'\fR.
Here \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR is the cardinality of \f(CW\*(C`G\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`(d_i)\*(C'\fR is the vector of elementary
divisors, and \f(CW\*(C`(g_i)\*(C'\fR is a vector of generators. In short,

.SS "Relative extensions"
.IX Subsection "Relative extensions"
When defining a relative extension, the base field \fInf\fR must be defined
by a variable having a lower priority (see "Label se:priority") than the
variable defining the extension. For example, you may use the variable name
\&\f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR to define the base field, and \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR to define the relative extension.
.PP
\&\fB*\fR \f(CW\*(C`\*(C'\fR\fIrnf\fR denotes a relative number field, i.e.\ a data structure

.SS "Class field theory"
.IX Subsection "Class field theory"
A \f(CW\*(C`\*(C'\fR\fImodulus\fR, in the sense of class field theory, is a divisor supported
on the non-complex places of \f(CW\*(C`K\*(C'\fR. In PARI terms, this means either an
ordinary ideal \f(CW\*(C`I\*(C'\fR as above (no archimedean component), or a pair \f(CW\*(C`[I,a]\*(C'\fR,
where \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR is a vector with \f(CW\*(C`r_1\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`{0,1}\*(C'\fR\-components, corresponding to the
infinite part of the divisor. More precisely, the \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR\-th component of \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR
corresponds to the real embedding associated to the \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR\-th real root of
\&\f(CW\*(C`K.roots\*(C'\fR. (That ordering is not canonical, but well defined once a
defining polynomial for \f(CW\*(C`K\*(C'\fR is chosen.) For instance, \f(CW\*(C`[1, [1,1]]\*(C'\fR is a
modulus for a real quadratic field, allowing ramification at any of the two
places at infinity.

Finally we explain how to input ray number fields (or \fIbnr\fR), using class
field theory. These are defined by a triple \f(CW\*(C`a1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a2\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a3\*(C'\fR, where the

modulo \fBf\fR, fixed by the given subgroup.

All the functions which are specific to relative extensions, number fields,
Buchmann's number fields, Buchmann's number rays, share the prefix \f(CW\*(C`rnf\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`nf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bnf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bnr\*(C'\fR respectively. They take as first argument a
number field of that precise type, respectively output by \f(CW\*(C`rnfinit\*(C'\fR,

.PP
However, and even though it may not be specified in the descriptions of the
functions below, it is permissible, if the function expects a \fInf\fR, to
use a \fIbnf\fR instead, which contains much more information. On the other
hand, if the function requires a \f(CW\*(C`bnf\*(C'\fR, it will \fInot\fR launch
\&\f(CW\*(C`bnfinit\*(C'\fR for you, which is a costly operation. Instead, it will give you
a specific error message. In short, the types
.PP
\ \ \f(CW\*(C` nf <= bnf <= bnr\*(C'\fR

are ordered, each function requires a minimal type to work properly, but you
may always substitute a larger type.
.PP
The data types corresponding to the structures described above are rather
complicated. Thus, as we already have seen it with elliptic curves, GP
provides ``member functions'' to retrieve data from these structures (once
they have been initialized of course). The relevant types of number fields

nfinit(\*(C'\fR\fIpol\fR\f(CW\*(C`)\*(C'\fR, both would have output an error message. All these
functions are completely recursive, thus for instance

you could get directly with a simple \fIbnr\fR\f(CW\*(C`.zk\*(C'\fR.

where the parameters are to be understood as follows:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR is the defining polynomial for the number field, which must be in
\&\fBZ\fR\f(CW\*(C`[X]\*(C'\fR, irreducible and monic. In fact, if you supply a non-monic polynomial
at this point, \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR issues a warning, then \fItransforms your
polynomial\fR so that it becomes monic. The \f(CW\*(C`nfinit\*(C'\fR routine
will return a different result in this case: instead of \f(CW\*(C`res\*(C'\fR, you get a
vector \f(CW\*(C`[res,Mod(a,Q)]\*(C'\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`Mod(a,Q) = Mod(X,P)\*(C'\fR gives the change
of variables. In all other routines, the variable change is simply lost.
.PP
The numbers \f(CW\*(C`c <= c_2\*(C'\fR are positive real numbers which control the
execution time and the stack size. For a given \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR, set
\&\f(CW\*(C`c_2 = c\*(C'\fR to get maximum speed. To get a rigorous result under GRH you
must take \f(CW\*(C`c2 >= 12\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`c2 >= 6\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR is quadratic). Reasonable values
for \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR are between \f(CW0.1\fR and \f(CW2\fR. The default is \f(CW\*(C`c = c_2 = 0.3\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "GRH"
.PP
\&\fInrpid\fR is the maximal number of small norm relations associated to each
ideal in the factor base. Set it to \f(CW0\fR to disable the search for small norm
relations. Otherwise, reasonable values are between 4 and 20. The default is
4.
.PP
\&\fBWarning..\fR Make sure you understand the above! By default, most of
the \f(CW\*(C`bnf\*(C'\fR routines depend on the correctness of a heuristic assumption
which is stronger than the GRH. In particular, any of the class number, class
group structure, class group generators, regulator and fundamental units may
be wrong, independently of each other. Any result computed from such a
\&\f(CW\*(C`bnf\*(C'\fR may be wrong. The only guarantee is that the units given generate a
subgroup of finite index in the full unit group. In practice, very few
counter-examples are known, requiring unlucky random seeds. No
counter-example has been reported for \f(CW\*(C`c_2 = 0.5\*(C'\fR (which should be almost as
fast as \f(CW\*(C`c_2 = 0.3\*(C'\fR, and shall very probably become the default). If you use
\&\f(CW\*(C`c_2 = 12\*(C'\fR, then everything is correct assuming the GRH holds. You can
use \f(CW\*(C`bnfcertify\*(C'\fR to certify the computations unconditionally.

Apart from the polynomial \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR, you do not need to supply the technical

specify a given value of

warned that this can take a very long time when the coefficients of the

of algebraic numbers as a formal product of algebraic integers. The latter is

Since PARI does not have a strong typing system, scalars live in
unspecified commutative base rings. It is very difficult to write
robust linear algebra routines in such a general setting. The
developpers's choice has been to assume the base ring is a domain
and work over its field of fractions. If the base ring is \fInot\fR
a domain, one gets an error as soon as a non-zero pivot turns out to be
non-invertible. Some functions, e.g.\ \f(CW\*(C`mathnf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mathnfmod\*(C'\fR,

In both these cases, \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is assumed to have integral entries. The

.IX Header "Sums, products, integrals and similar functions"

Although the \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR calculator is programmable, it is useful to have
preprogrammed a number of loops, including sums, products, and a certain
number of recursions. Also, a number of functions from numerical analysis
like numerical integration and summation of series will be described here.
.IX Xref "Label se:sums"
.PP
One of the parameters in these loops must be the control variable, hence a
simple variable name. In the descriptions, the letter \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR will always denote
any simple variable name, and represents the formal parameter used in the
function. The expression to be summed, integrated, etc. is any legal PARI
expression, including of course expressions using loops.
.PP
\&\fBLibrary mode..\fR
Since it is easier to program directly the loops in library mode, these
functions are mainly useful for GP programming. Using them in library mode is
tricky and we will not give any details, although the reader can try and figure
it out by himself by checking the example given for \f(CW\*(C`sum\*(C'\fR.

On the other hand, numerical routines code a function (to be integrated,
summed, etc.) with two parameters named

.PP
The second is meant to contain all auxilliary data needed by your function.
The first is such that \f(CW\*(C`eval(x, E)\*(C'\fR returns your function evaluated at
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR. For instance, one may code the family of functions
\&\f(CW\*(C`f_t: x \eto (x+t)^2\*(C'\fR via
.PP

.PP
\&\fBNumerical integration..\fR
Starting with version 2.2.9 the powerful ``double exponential'' univariate
integration method is implemented in \f(CW\*(C`intnum\*(C'\fR and its variants. Romberg
integration is still available under the name \f(CW\*(C`intnumromb\*(C'\fR, but
superseded. It is possible to compute numerically integrals to thousands of
decimal places in reasonable time, as long as the integrand is regular. It is
also reasonable to compute numerically integrals in several variables,
although more than two becomes lengthy. The integration domain may be
non-compact, and the integrand may have reasonable singularities at
endpoints. To use \f(CW\*(C`intnum\*(C'\fR, the user must split the integral into a sum
of subintegrals where the function has (possible) singularities only at the
endpoints. Polynomials in logarithms are not considered singular, and
neglecting these logs, singularities are assumed to be algebraic (in other
words asymptotic to \f(CW\*(C`C(x\-a)^{\-\*(C'\fR\fIalpha\fR\f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR for some \fIalpha\fR such that
\&\fIalpha\fR\f(CW\*(C` > \-1\*(C'\fR when \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is close to \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR), or to correspond to simple
discontinuities of some (higher) derivative of the function. For instance,
the point \f(CW0\fR is a singularity of \f(CWabs(x)\fR.

Here it is critical to give the exact value of \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR. If the
oscillating part is not a pure sine or cosine, one must expand it into a
Fourier series, use the above codings, and sum the resulting contributions.
Otherwise you will get nonsense. Note that  \fIcos\fR \f(CW\*(C`(kx)\*(C'\fR (and similarly

oscillations are much weaker than the exponential decrease, choose
\&\f(CW\*(C`[[\fR\f(CI+\-\fR\f(CW1],\*(C'\fR\fIalpha\fR\f(CW\*(C`]\*(C'\fR, otherwise choose \f(CW\*(C`[[\fR\f(CI+\-\fR\f(CW1],kI]\*(C'\fR, although the latter can
reasonably be used in all cases, while the former cannot. To take a specific
example, in the inverse Mellin transform, the function to be integrated is
almost always exponentially decreasing times oscillating. If we choose the
oscillating type of integral we perhaps obtain the best results, at the
expense of having to recompute our functions for a different value of the
variable \f(CW\*(C`z\*(C'\fR giving the transform, preventing us to use a function such as

recomputations. See \f(CW\*(C`intmellininvshort\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`intfuncinit\*(C'\fR for more

\&\fBMultivariate integration..\fR
Using successive univariate integration with respect to different formal
parameters, it is immediate to do naive multivariate integration. But it is
important to use a suitable \f(CW\*(C`intnuminit\*(C'\fR to precompute data for the
\&\fIinternal\fR integrations at least!
.PP
For example, to compute the double integral on the unit disc \f(CW\*(C`x^2+y^2 <= 1\*(C'\fR
of the function \f(CW\*(C`x^2+y^2\*(C'\fR, we can write
.PP
.Vb 2

.Vb 4
\&  ? intnum(x=\-1,1, intnum(y=\-sqrt(1\-x^2),sqrt(1\-x^2), x^2+y^2, tab), tab);

.PP
However, the \f(CW\*(C`intnuminit\*(C'\fR program is usually pessimistic when it comes to
choosing the integration step \f(CW\*(C`2^{\-m}\*(C'\fR. It is often possible to improve the
speed by trial and error. Continuing the above example:

The user should not require too much accuracy: 18 or 28 decimal digits is OK,
but not much more. In addition, analytical cleanup of the integral must have
been done: there must be no singularities in the interval or at the
boundaries. In practice this can be accomplished with a simple change of
variable. Furthermore, for improper integrals, where one or both of the
limits of integration are plus or minus infinity, the function must decrease
sufficiently rapidly at infinity. This can often be accomplished through
integration by parts. Finally, the function to be integrated should not be
very small (compared to the current precision) on the entire interval. This
can of course be accomplished by just multiplying by an appropriate constant.
.PP
Note that infinity can be represented with essentially no loss of
accuracy by 1e1000. However beware of real underflow when dealing with
rapidly decreasing functions. For example, if one wants to compute the
\&\fIint\fR\f(CW\*(C`_0^ oo e^{\-x^2}dx\*(C'\fR to 28 decimal digits, then one should set
infinity equal to 10 for example, and certainly not to 1e1000.

Although plotting is not even a side purpose of PARI, a number of plotting
functions are provided. Moreover, a lot of people suggested ideas or submitted
patches for this section of the code. Among these, special thanks go to
Klaus-Peter Nischke who suggested the recursive plotting and the
forking/resizing stuff under X11, and Ilya Zakharevich who undertook a
complete rewrite of the graphic code, so that most of it is now
platform-independent and should be easy to port or expand. There are three
types of graphic functions.
.SS "High-level plotting functions"
.IX Subsection "High-level plotting functions"
(all the functions starting with \f(CW\*(C`ploth\*(C'\fR) in which the user has little to
do but explain what type of plot he wants, and whose syntax is similar to the
one used in the preceding section.
.SS "Low-level plotting functions"
.IX Subsection "Low-level plotting functions"
(called \fIrectplot\fR functions,
sharing the prefix \f(CW\*(C`plot\*(C'\fR), where every drawing primitive (point, line,
box, etc.) is specified by the user. These low-level functions work as
follows. You have at your disposal 16 virtual windows which are filled
independently, and can then be physically ORed on a single window at
user-defined positions. These windows are numbered from 0 to 15, and must be
initialized before being used by the function \f(CW\*(C`plotinit\*(C'\fR, which specifies
the height and width of the virtual window (called a \fIrectwindow\fR in the
sequel). At all times, a virtual cursor (initialized at \f(CW\*(C`[0,0]\*(C'\fR) is associated
to the window, and its current value can be obtained using the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`plotcursor\*(C'\fR.
.PP
A number of primitive graphic objects (called \fIrect\fR objects) can then
be drawn in these windows, using a default color associated to that window
(which can be changed under X11, using the \f(CW\*(C`plotcolor\*(C'\fR function, black
otherwise) and only the part of the object which is inside the window will be
drawn, with the exception of polygons and strings which are drawn entirely.
The ones sharing the prefix \f(CW\*(C`plotr\*(C'\fR draw relatively to the current
position of the virtual cursor, the others use absolute coordinates. Those
having the prefix \f(CW\*(C`plotrecth\*(C'\fR put in the rectwindow a large batch of rect
objects corresponding to the output of the related \f(CW\*(C`ploth\*(C'\fR function.
.PP
Finally, the actual physical drawing is done using the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`plotdraw\*(C'\fR. The rectwindows are preserved so that further drawings
using the same windows at different positions or different windows can be
done without extra work. To erase a window (and free the corresponding
memory), use the function \f(CW\*(C`plotkill\*(C'\fR. It is not possible to partially
erase a window. Erase it completely, initialize it again and then fill it with
the graphic objects that you want to keep.
.PP
In addition to initializing the window, you may use a scaled
window to avoid unnecessary conversions. For this, use the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`plotscale\*(C'\fR below. As long as this function is not called, the scaling is
simply the number of pixels, the origin being at the upper left and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR\-coordinates going downwards.
.PP
Note that in the present version \fB2.3.5\fR all plotting functions (both low
and high level) are written for the X11\-window system (hence also for GUI's
based on X11 such as Openwindows and Motif) only, though little code
remains which is actually platform-dependent. It is also possible to compile
\&\f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR with either of the Qt or FLTK graphical libraries. A
Suntools/Sunview, Macintosh, and an Atari/Gem port were provided for previous
versions, but are now obsolete.
.PP
Under X11, the physical window (opened by \f(CW\*(C`plotdraw\*(C'\fR or any of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ploth*\*(C'\fR functions) is completely separated from \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR (technically, a
\&\f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR is done, and the non-graphical memory is immediately freed in the
child process), which means you can go on working in the current \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR
session, without having to kill the window first. Under X11, this window can
be closed, enlarged or reduced using the standard window manager functions.
No zooming procedure is implemented though (yet).
.SS "Functions for PostScript output:"
.IX Subsection "Functions for PostScript output:"
in the same way that \f(CW\*(C`printtex\*(C'\fR allows you to have a TeX output
corresponding to printed results, the functions starting with \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR allow
you to have \f(CW\*(C`PostScript\*(C'\fR output of the plots. This will not be absolutely
identical with the screen output, but will be sufficiently close. Note that
you can use PostScript output even if you do not have the plotting routines
enabled. The PostScript output is written in a file whose name is derived from
the \f(CW\*(C`psfile\*(C'\fR default (\f(CW\*(C`./pari.ps\*(C'\fR if you did not tamper with it). Each

the difference between \fIstrings\fR and \fIkeywords\fR (see

If you simply want to restore a variable to its ``undefined'' value
(monomial of degree one), use the quote operator: \f(CW\*(C`a = \*(Aqa\*(C'\fR.

Another possibility is to enable the \f(CW\*(C`log\*(C'\fR default

gives a new order of importance of the variables, \fIfor output only\fR. For
example, if the existing order is \f(CW\*(C`[x,y,z]\*(C'\fR, then after

readable, but contains the exact internal structure of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR, and is much
faster to save/load than a string expression, as would be produced by
\&\f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR. The binary file format includes a magic number, so that such a

If \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is omitted, saves all user variables from the session, together with
their names. Reading such a ``named object'' back in a \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR session will set
the corresponding user variable to the saved value. E.g after
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  x = 1; writebin("log")
.Ve
.PP
reading \f(CW\*(C`log\*(C'\fR into a clean session will set \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.
The relative variables priorities (see "Label se:priority") of new variables
set in this way remain the same (preset variables retain their former
priority, but are set to the new value). In particular, reading such a
session log into a clean session will restore all variables exactly as they
were in the original one.
.PP
User functions, installed functions and history objects can not be saved via
this function. Just as a regular input file, a binary file can be compressed

extension.

In the present implementation, the binary files are architecture dependent
and compatibility with future versions of \f(CW\*(C`gp\*(C'\fR is not guaranteed. Hence
binary files should not be used for long term storage (also, they are
