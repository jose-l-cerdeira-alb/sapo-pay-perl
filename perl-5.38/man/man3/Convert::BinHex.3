.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBBinHex\fR is a format used by Macintosh for transporting Mac files
safely through electronic mail, as short-lined, 7\-bit, semi-compressed
data streams.  Ths module provides a means of converting those
data streams back into into binary data.
.SH FORMAT
.IX Header "FORMAT"
\&\fI(Some text taken from RFC\-1741.)\fR
Files on the Macintosh consist of two parts, called \fIforks\fR:
.IP "Data fork" 4
.IX Item "Data fork"
The actual data included in the file.  The Data fork is typically the
only meaningful part of a Macintosh file on a non-Macintosh computer system.
For example, if a Macintosh user wants to send a file of data to a
user on an IBM-PC, she would only send the Data fork.
.IP "Resource fork" 4
.IX Item "Resource fork"
Contains a collection of arbitrary attribute/value pairs, including
program segments, icon bitmaps, and parametric values.
.PP
Additional information regarding Macintosh files is stored by the
Finder in a hidden file, called the "Desktop Database".
.PP
Because of the complications in storing different parts of a
Macintosh file in a non-Macintosh filesystem that only handles
consecutive data in one part, it is common to convert the Macintosh
file into some other format before transferring it over the network.
The BinHex format squashes that data into transmittable ASCII as follows:
.IP 1. 4
The file is output as a \fBbyte stream\fR consisting of some basic header
information (filename, type, creator), then the data fork, then the
resource fork.
.IP 2. 4
The byte stream is \fBcompressed\fR by looking for series of duplicated
bytes and representing them using a special binary escape sequence
(of course, any occurences of the escape character must also be escaped).
.IP 3. 4
The compressed stream is \fBencoded\fR via the "6/8 hemiola" common
to \fIbase64\fR and \fIuuencode\fR: each group of three 8\-bit bytes (24 bits)
is chopped into four 6\-bit numbers, which are used as indexes into
an ASCII "alphabet".
(I assume that leftover bytes are zero-padded; documentation is thin).

.IP "macbinary_crc DATA, SEED" 4
.IX Item "macbinary_crc DATA, SEED"
Compute the MacBinary-II-style CRC for the given DATA, with the CRC
seeded to SEED.  Normally, you start with a SEED of 0, and you pump in
the previous CRC as the SEED if you're handling a lot of data one chunk
at a time.  That is:
.Sp

.IP "new PARAMHASH" 4
.IX Item "new PARAMHASH"
\&\fIClass method, constructor.\fR
Return a handle on a BinHex'able entity.  In general, the data and resource
forks for such an entity are stored in native format (binary) format.
.Sp
Parameters in the PARAMHASH are the same as header-oriented method names,
and may be used to set attributes:
.Sp

.Ve
.IP "open PARAMHASH" 4
.IX Item "open PARAMHASH"
\&\fIClass method, constructor.\fR
Return a handle on a new BinHex'ed stream, for parsing.
Params are:
.RS 4
.IP Data 4
.IX Item "Data"
Input a HEX stream from the given data.  This can be a scalar, or a
reference to an array of scalars.
.IP Expr 4
.IX Item "Expr"
Input a HEX stream from any \fBopen()\fRable expression.  It will be opened and
binmode'd, and the filehandle will be closed either on a \f(CWclose()\fR
or when the object is destructed.
.IP FH 4
.IX Item "FH"
Input a HEX stream from the given filehandle.
.IP NoComment 4

.IP "creator [VALUE]" 4
.IX Item "creator [VALUE]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Get/set the creator of the file.  This is a four-character
string (though I don't know if it's guaranteed to be printable ASCII!)
that serves as part of the Macintosh's version of a MIME "content-type".
.Sp
For example, a document created by "Canvas" might have
creator \f(CW"CNVS"\fR.
.IP "data [PARAMHASH]" 4
.IX Item "data [PARAMHASH]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Get/set the data fork.  Any arguments are passed into the
\&\fBnew()\fR method of "Convert::BinHex::Fork".
.IP "filename [VALUE]" 4
.IX Item "filename [VALUE]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Get/set the name of the file.
.IP "flags [VALUE]" 4

\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Return the flags, as an integer.  Use bitmasking to get as the values
you need.
.IP header_as_string 4
.IX Item "header_as_string"
Return a stringified version of the header that you might
use for logging/debugging purposes.  It looks like this:
.Sp

As some of you might have guessed, this is RFC\-822\-style, and
may be easily plunked down into the middle of a mail header, or
split into lines, etc.
.IP "requires [VALUE]" 4
.IX Item "requires [VALUE]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Get/set the software version required to convert this file, as
extracted from the comment that preceded the actual binhex'ed
data; e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, after parsing in the comment, the code:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $HQX\->requires;
.Ve
.Sp
would get back "4.0".
.IP "resource [PARAMHASH]" 4
.IX Item "resource [PARAMHASH]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Get/set the resource fork.  Any arguments are passed into the
\&\fBnew()\fR method of "Convert::BinHex::Fork".
.IP "type [VALUE]" 4
.IX Item "type [VALUE]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Get/set the type of the file.  This is a four-character
string (though I don't know if it's guaranteed to be printable ASCII!)
that serves as part of the Macintosh's version of a MIME "content-type".
.Sp
For example, a GIF89a file might have type \f(CW"GF89"\fR.
.IP "version [VALUE]" 4
.IX Item "version [VALUE]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Get/set the version, as an integer.
.SS "Decode, high-level"

.IP read_comment 4
.IX Item "read_comment"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Skip past the opening comment in the file, which is of the form:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)
.Ve
.Sp
As per RFC\-1741, \fIthis comment must immediately precede the BinHex data,\fR
and any text before it will be ignored.
.Sp
\&\fIYou don't need to invoke this method yourself;\fR \f(CWread_header()\fR will
do it for you.  After the call, the version number in the comment is
accessible via the \f(CWrequires()\fR method.
.IP read_header 4
.IX Item "read_header"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Read in the BinHex file header.  You must do this first!
.IP "read_data [NBYTES]" 4
.IX Item "read_data [NBYTES]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Read information from the data fork.  Use it in an array context to
slurp all the data into an array of scalars:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @data = $HQX\->read_data;
.Ve
.Sp
Or use it in a scalar context to get the data piecemeal:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    while (defined($data = $HQX\->read_data)) {

\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
The NBYTES to read defaults to 2048.
.IP "read_resource [NBYTES]" 4

A BINary-to-HEX converter.  This kind of conversion requires
a certain amount of state information; it cannot be done by
just calling a simple function repeatedly.  Use it like this:
.PP

\&    $B2H\->rewind;                 # ready for more action!
\&    while (<MOREIN>) { ...
.Ve
.PP
On each iteration, \f(CWnext()\fR (and \f(CWdone()\fR) may return either
a decent-sized non-empty string (indicating that more converted data
is ready for you) or an empty string (indicating that the converter
is waiting to amass more input in its private buffers before handing
you more stuff to output.
.PP
Note that \f(CWdone()\fR \fIalways\fR converts and hands you whatever is left.
.PP
This may have been a good approach.  It may not.  Someday, the converter
may also allow you give it an object that responds to \fBread()\fR, or
a FileHandle, and it will do all the nasty buffer-filling on its own,
serving you stuff line by line:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    # Someday, maybe...
\&    my $B2H = Convert::BinHex\->bin2hex(\e*STDIN);

.IP "BinHex needs a stateful parser" 4
.IX Item "BinHex needs a stateful parser"
Unlike its cousins \fIbase64\fR and \fIuuencode\fR, BinHex format is not
amenable to being parsed line-by-line.  There appears to be no
guarantee that lines contain 4n encoded characters... and even if there
is one, the BinHex compression algorithm interferes: even when you
can \fIdecode\fR one line at a time, you can't necessarily
\&\fIdecompress\fR a line at a time.
.Sp
For example: a decoded line ending with the byte \f(CW\*(C`\ex90\*(C'\fR (the escape
or "mark" character) is ambiguous: depending on the next decoded byte,
it could mean a literal \f(CW\*(C`\ex90\*(C'\fR (if the next byte is a \f(CW\*(C`\ex00\*(C'\fR), or
it could mean n\-1 more repetitions of the previous character (if
the next byte is some nonzero \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
For this reason, a BinHex parser has to be somewhat stateful: you
cannot have code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    #### NO! #### NO! #### NO! #### NO! #### NO! ####
\&    while (<STDIN>) {            # read HEX
\&        print hexbin($_);          # convert and write BIN
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
unless something is happening "behind the scenes" to keep track of
what was last done.  \fIThe dangerous thing, however, is that this
approach will \fR\f(BIseem\fR\fI to work, if you only test it on BinHex files
which do not use compression and which have 4n HEX characters
on each line.\fR
.Sp
Since we have to be stateful anyway, we use the parser object to
keep our state.
.IP "We need to be handle large input files" 4
.IX Item "We need to be handle large input files"
Solutions that demand reading everything into core don't cut
it in my book.  The first MPEG file that comes along can louse
up your whole day.  So, there are no size limitations in this
module: the data is read on-demand, and filehandles are always
an option.
.IP "Boy, is this slow!" 4
.IX Item "Boy, is this slow!"
A lot of the byte-level manipulation that has to go on, particularly
the CRC computing (which involves intensive bit-shifting and masking)
slows this module down significantly.  What is needed perhaps is an
\&\fIoptional\fR extension library where the slow pieces can be done more
quickly... a Convert::BinHex::CRC, if you will.  Volunteers, anyone?
.Sp
Even considering that, however, it's slower than I'd like.  I'm
sure many improvements can be made in the HEX-to-BIN end of things.
No doubt I'll attempt some as time goes on...
.SS "How it works"
.IX Subsection "How it works"
Since BinHex is a layered format, consisting of...
.PP
.Vb 4
\&      A Macintosh file [the "BIN"]...
\&         Encoded as a structured 8\-bit bytestream, then...
\&            Compressed to reduce duplicate bytes, then...
\&               Encoded as 7\-bit ASCII [the "HEX"]
.Ve
.PP
\&...there is a layered parsing algorithm to reverse the process.
Basically, it works in a similar fashion to stdio's \fBfread()\fR:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&       0. There is an internal buffer of decompressed (BIN) data,
\&          initially empty.
\&       1. Application asks to read() n bytes of data from object
\&       2. If the buffer is not full enough to accommodate the request:
\&            2a. The read() method grabs the next available chunk of input
\&                data (the HEX).
\&            2b. HEX data is converted and decompressed into as many BIN
\&                bytes as possible.
\&            2c. BIN bytes are added to the read() buffer.
\&            2d. Go back to step 2a. until the buffer is full enough
\&                or we hit end\-of\-input.
.Ve
.PP
The conversion-and-decompression algorithms need their own internal
buffers and state (since the next input chunk may not contain all the
data needed for a complete conversion/decompression operation).
These are maintained in the object, so parsing two different
input streams simultaneously is possible.
