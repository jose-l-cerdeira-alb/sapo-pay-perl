.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides tools for building external (non-CPAN) dependencies
for CPAN.  It is mainly designed to be used at install time of a CPAN
client, and work closely with Alien::Base which is used at runtime.
.PP
This is the detailed documentation for the Alien::Build class.
If you are starting out you probably want to do so from one of these documents:
.IP Alien::Build::Manual::Alien 4
.IX Item "Alien::Build::Manual::Alien"
A broad overview of \f(CW\*(C`Alien\-Build\*(C'\fR and its ecosystem.
.IP Alien::Build::Manual::AlienUser 4
.IX Item "Alien::Build::Manual::AlienUser"
For users of an \f(CW\*(C`Alien::libfoo\*(C'\fR that is implemented using Alien::Base.
(The developer of \f(CW\*(C`Alien::libfoo\*(C'\fR \fIshould\fR provide the documentation
necessary, but if not, this is the place to start).
.IP Alien::Build::Manual::AlienAuthor 4
.IX Item "Alien::Build::Manual::AlienAuthor"
If you are writing your own Alien based on Alien::Build and Alien::Base.
.IP Alien::Build::Manual::FAQ 4
.IX Item "Alien::Build::Manual::FAQ"
If you have a common question that has already been answered, like
"How do I use alienfile with some build system".
.IP Alien::Build::Manual::PluginAuthor 4
.IX Item "Alien::Build::Manual::PluginAuthor"
This is for the brave souls who want to write plugins that will work with
Alien::Build + alienfile.
.IP Alien::Build::Manual::Security 4
.IX Item "Alien::Build::Manual::Security"
If you are concerned that Aliens might be downloading tarballs off
the internet, then this is the place for you.  This will discuss some
of the risks of downloading (really any) software off the internet
and will give you some tools to remediate these risks.
.PP
Note that you will not usually create a Alien::Build instance
directly, but rather be using a thin installer layer, such as
Alien::Build::MM (for use with ExtUtils::MakeMaker) or
Alien::Build::MB (for use with Module::Build).  One of the
goals of this project is to remain installer agnostic.
.SH CONSTRUCTORS
.IX Header "CONSTRUCTORS"
.SS new
.IX Subsection "new"
.Vb 1
\& my $build = Alien::Build\->new;
.Ve
.PP
This creates a new empty instance of Alien::Build.  Normally you will
want to use \f(CW\*(C`load\*(C'\fR below to create an instance of Alien::Build from
an alienfile recipe.
.SS load
.IX Subsection "load"
.Vb 1
\& my $build = Alien::Build\->load($alienfile);
.Ve
.PP
This creates an Alien::Build instance with the given alienfile
recipe.
.SS resume
.IX Subsection "resume"
.Vb 1
\& my $build = Alien::Build\->resume($alienfile, $root);
.Ve
.PP
Load a checkpointed Alien::Build instance.  You will need the original
alienfile and the build root (usually \f(CW\*(C`_alien\*(C'\fR), and a build that
had been properly checkpointed using the \f(CW\*(C`checkpoint\*(C'\fR method below.
.SH PROPERTIES
.IX Header "PROPERTIES"
There are three main properties for Alien::Build.  There are a number
of properties documented here with a specific usage.  Note that these
properties may need to be serialized into something primitive like JSON
that does not support: regular expressions, code references of blessed
objects.
.PP
If you are writing a plugin (Alien::Build::Plugin) you should use a
prefix like "plugin_\fIname\fR" (where \fIname\fR is the name of your plugin)
so that it does not interfere with other plugin or future versions of
Alien::Build.  For example, if you were writing
\&\f(CW\*(C`Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::NewProtocol\*(C'\fR, please use the prefix
\&\f(CW\*(C`plugin_fetch_newprotocol\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& sub init
\& {
\&   my($self, $meta) = @_;
\& 
\&   $meta\->prop( plugin_fetch_newprotocol_foo => \*(Aqsome value\*(Aq );
\& 
\&   $meta\->register_hook(
\&     some_hook => sub {
\&       my($build) = @_;
\&       $build\->install_prop\->{plugin_fetch_newprotocol_bar} = \*(Aqsome other value\*(Aq;
\&       $build\->runtime_prop\->{plugin_fetch_newprotocol_baz} = \*(Aqand another value\*(Aq;
\&     }
\&   );
\& }
.Ve
.PP
If you are writing a alienfile recipe please use the prefix \f(CW\*(C`my_\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& use alienfile;
\& 
\& meta_prop\->{my_foo} = \*(Aqsome value\*(Aq;
\& 
\& probe sub {
\&   my($build) = @_;
\&   $build\->install_prop\->{my_bar} = \*(Aqsome other value\*(Aq;
\&   $build\->install_prop\->{my_baz} = \*(Aqand another value\*(Aq;
\& };
.Ve
.PP
Any property may be used from a command:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& probe [ \*(Aqsome command %{.meta.plugin_fetch_newprotocol_foo}\*(Aq ];
\& probe [ \*(Aqsome command %{.install.plugin_fetch_newprotocol_bar}\*(Aq ];
\& probe [ \*(Aqsome command %{.runtime.plugin_fetch_newprotocol_baz}\*(Aq ];
\& probe [ \*(Aqsome command %{.meta.my_foo}\*(Aq ];
\& probe [ \*(Aqsome command %{.install.my_bar}\*(Aq ];
\& probe [ \*(Aqsome command %{.runtime.my_baz}\*(Aq ];
.Ve
.SS meta_prop
.IX Subsection "meta_prop"
.Vb 2
\& my $href = $build\->meta_prop;
\& my $href = Alien::Build\->meta_prop;
.Ve
.PP
Meta properties have to do with the recipe itself, and not any particular
instance that probes or builds that recipe.  Meta properties can be changed
from within an alienfile using the \f(CW\*(C`meta_prop\*(C'\fR directive, or from
a plugin from its \f(CW\*(C`init\*(C'\fR method (though should NOT be modified from any
hooks registered within that \f(CW\*(C`init\*(C'\fR method).  This is not strictly enforced,
but if you do not follow this rule your recipe will likely be broken.
.IP arch 4
.IX Item "arch"
This is a hint to an installer like Alien::Build::MM or Alien::Build::MB,
that the library or tool contains architecture dependent files and so should
be stored in an architecture dependent location.  If not specified by your
alienfile then it will be set to true.
.IP check_digest 4
.IX Item "check_digest"
True if cryptographic digest should be checked when files are fetched
or downloaded.  This is set by
Digest negotiator plugin.
.IP destdir 4
.IX Item "destdir"
Some plugins (Alien::Build::Plugin::Build::Autoconf for example) support
installing via \f(CW\*(C`DESTDIR\*(C'\fR.  They will set this property to true if they
plan on doing such an install.  This helps Alien::Build find the staged
install files and how to locate them.
.Sp
If available, \f(CW\*(C`DESTDIR\*(C'\fR is used to stage install files in a sub directory before
copying the files into \f(CW\*(C`blib\*(C'\fR.  This is generally preferred method
if available.
.IP destdir_filter 4
.IX Item "destdir_filter"
Regular expression for the files that should be copied from the \f(CW\*(C`DESTDIR\*(C'\fR
into the stage directory.  If not defined, then all files will be copied.
.IP destdir_ffi_filter 4
.IX Item "destdir_ffi_filter"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`destdir_filter\*(C'\fR except applies to \f(CW\*(C`build_ffi\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`build\*(C'\fR.
.IP digest 4
.IX Item "digest"
This properties contains the cryptographic digests (if any) that should
be used when verifying any fetched and downloaded files.  It is a hash
reference where the key is the filename and the value is an array
reference containing a pair of values, the first being the algorithm
('SHA256' is recommended) and the second is the actual digest.  The
special filename \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR may be specified to indicate that any downloaded
file should match that digest.  If there are both real filenames and
the \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR placeholder, the real filenames will be used for filenames
that match and any other files will use the placeholder.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& $build\->meta_prop\->{digest} = {
\&   \*(Aqfoo\-1.00.tar.gz\*(Aq => [ SHA256 => \*(Aq9feac593aa49a44eb837de52513a57736457f1ea70078346c60f0bfc5f24f2c1\*(Aq ],
\&   \*(Aqfoo\-1.01.tar.gz\*(Aq => [ SHA256 => \*(Aq6bbde6a7f10ae5924cf74afc26ff5b7bc4b4f9dfd85c6b534c51bd254697b9e7\*(Aq ],
\&   \*(Aq*\*(Aq               => [ SHA256 => \*(Aq33a20aae3df6ecfbe812b48082926d55391be4a57d858d35753ab1334b9fddb3\*(Aq ],
\& };
.Ve
.Sp
Cryptographic signatures will only be checked
if the check_digest meta property is set and if the
Digest negotiator plugin is loaded.
(The Digest negotiator can be used directly, but is also loaded automatically
if you use the digest directive is used by the alienfile).
.IP env 4
.IX Item "env"
Environment variables to override during the build stage.
.IP env_interpolate 4
.IX Item "env_interpolate"
Environment variable values will be interpolated with helpers.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& meta\->prop\->{env_interpolate} = 1;
\& meta\->prop\->{env}\->{PERL} = \*(Aq%{perl}\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP local_source 4
.IX Item "local_source"
Set to true if source code package is available locally.  (that is not fetched
over the internet).  This is computed by default based on the \f(CW\*(C`start_url\*(C'\fR
property.  Can be set by an alienfile or plugin.
.IP platform 4
.IX Item "platform"
Hash reference.  Contains information about the platform beyond just \f(CW$^O\fR.
.RS 4
.IP platform.compiler_type 4
.IX Item "platform.compiler_type"
Refers to the type of flags that the compiler accepts.  May be expanded in the
future, but for now, will be one of:
.RS 4
.IP microsoft 4
.IX Item "microsoft"
On Windows when using Microsoft Visual C++
.IP unix 4
.IX Item "unix"
Virtually everything else, including gcc on windows.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The main difference is that with Visual C++ \f(CW\*(C`\-LIBPATH\*(C'\fR should be used instead
of \f(CW\*(C`\-L\*(C'\fR, and static libraries should have the \f(CW\*(C`.LIB\*(C'\fR suffix instead of \f(CW\*(C`.a\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.IP platform.system_type 4
.IX Item "platform.system_type"
\&\f(CW$^O\fR is frequently good enough to make platform specific logic in your
alienfile, this handles the case when $^O can cover platforms that provide
multiple environments that Perl might run under.  The main example is windows,
but others may be added in the future.

Note that \f(CW\*(C`cygwin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`msys\*(C'\fR are considered \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR even though they run
on windows!
.RE
.IP platform.cpu.count 4
.IX Item "platform.cpu.count"
Contains a non-negative integer of available (possibly virtual) CPUs on the
system. This can be used by build plugins to build in parallel. The environment
variable \f(CW\*(C`ALIEN_CPU_COUNT\*(C'\fR can be set to override the CPU count.
.IP platform.cpu.arch.name 4
.IX Item "platform.cpu.arch.name"
Contains a normalized name for the architecture of the current Perl. This can
be used by fetch plugins to determine which binary packages to download.
The value may be one of the following, but this list will be expanded as
needed.

.IP out_of_source 4
.IX Item "out_of_source"
Build in a different directory from the where the source code is stored.
In autoconf this is referred to as a "VPATH" build.  Everyone else calls this
an "out-of-source" build.  When this property is true, instead of extracting
to the source build root, the downloaded source will be extracted to an source
extraction directory and the source build root will be empty.  You can use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`extract\*(C'\fR install property to get the location of the extracted source.
.IP network 4
.IX Item "network"
True if a network fetch is available.  This should NOT be set by an alienfile
or plugin.  This is computed based on the \f(CW\*(C`ALIEN_INSTALL_NETWORK\*(C'\fR environment
variables.
.IP start_url 4
.IX Item "start_url"
The default or start URL used by fetch plugins.
.SS install_prop
.IX Subsection "install_prop"
.Vb 1
\& my $href = $build\->install_prop;
.Ve
.PP
Install properties are used during the install phase (either
under \f(CW\*(C`share\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR install).  They are remembered for
the entire install phase, but not kept around during the runtime
phase.  Thus they cannot be accessed from your Alien::Base
based module.
.IP autoconf_prefix 4
.IX Item "autoconf_prefix"
The prefix as understood by autoconf.  This is only different on Windows
Where MSYS is used and paths like \f(CW\*(C`C:/foo\*(C'\fR are  represented as \f(CW\*(C`/C/foo\*(C'\fR
which are understood by the MSYS tools, but not by Perl.  You should
only use this if you are using Alien::Build::Plugin::Build::Autoconf in
your alienfile.  This is set during before the
build hook is run.
.IP download 4
.IX Item "download"
The location of the downloaded archive (tar.gz, or similar) or directory.
This will be undefined until the archive is actually downloaded.
.IP download_detail 4
.IX Item "download_detail"
This property contains optional details about a downloaded file.  This
property is populated by Alien::Build core.  This property is a
hash reference.  The key is the path to the file that has been downloaded
and the value is a hash reference with additional detail.  All fields
are optional.
.RS 4
.IP download_detail.digest 4
.IX Item "download_detail.digest"
This, if available, with the cryptographic signature that was successfully
matched against the downloaded file.  It is an array reference with a
pair of values, the algorithm (typically something like \f(CW\*(C`SHA256\*(C'\fR) and
the digest.
.IP download_detail.protocol 4
.IX Item "download_detail.protocol"
This, if available, will be the URL protocol used to fetch the downloaded
file.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP env 4
.IX Item "env"
Environment variables to override during the build stage.  Plugins are
free to set additional overrides using this hash.
.IP extract 4
.IX Item "extract"
The location of the last source extraction.  For a "out-of-source" build
(see the \f(CW\*(C`out_of_source\*(C'\fR meta property above), this will only be set once.
For other types of builds, the source code may be extracted multiple times,
and thus this property may change.
.IP old 4
.IX Item "old"
[deprecated]
.Sp
Hash containing information on a previously installed Alien of the same
name, if available.  This may be useful in cases where you want to
reuse the previous install if it is still sufficient.
.RS 4
.IP old.prefix 4
.IX Item "old.prefix"
[deprecated]
.Sp
The prefix for the previous install.  Versions prior to 1.42 unfortunately
had this in typo form of \f(CW\*(C`preifx\*(C'\fR.
.IP old.runtime 4
.IX Item "old.runtime"
[deprecated]
.Sp
The runtime properties from the previous install.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP patch 4
.IX Item "patch"
Directory with patches, if available.  This will be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if there
are no patches.  When initially installing an alien this will usually
be a sibling of the \f(CW\*(C`alienfile\*(C'\fR, a directory called \f(CW\*(C`patch\*(C'\fR.  Once
installed this will be in the share directory called \f(CW\*(C`_alien/patch\*(C'\fR.
The former is useful for rebuilding an alienized package using
af.
.IP prefix 4
.IX Item "prefix"
The install time prefix.  Under a \f(CW\*(C`destdir\*(C'\fR install this is the
same as the runtime or final install location.  Under a non\-\f(CW\*(C`destdir\*(C'\fR
install this is the \f(CW\*(C`stage\*(C'\fR directory (usually the appropriate
share directory under \f(CW\*(C`blib\*(C'\fR).
.IP root 4
.IX Item "root"
The build root directory.  This will be an absolute path.  It is the
absolute form of \f(CW\*(C`./_alien\*(C'\fR by default.
.IP stage 4
.IX Item "stage"
The stage directory where files will be copied.  This is usually the
root of the blib share directory.
.IP system_probe_class 4
.IX Item "system_probe_class"
After the probe step this property may contain the plugin class that
performed the system probe.  It shouldn't be filled in directly by
the plugin (instead if should use the hook property \f(CW\*(C`probe_class\*(C'\fR,
see below).  This is optional, and not all probe plugins will provide
this information.
.IP system_probe_instance_id 4
.IX Item "system_probe_instance_id"
After the probe step this property may contain the plugin instance id that
performed the system probe.  It shouldn't be filled in directly by
the plugin (instead if should use the hook property \f(CW\*(C`probe_instance_id\*(C'\fR,
see below).  This is optional, and not all probe plugins will provide
this information.
.SS plugin_instance_prop
.IX Subsection "plugin_instance_prop"
.Vb 1
\& my $href = $build\->plugin_instance_prop($plugin);
.Ve
.PP
This returns the private plugin instance properties for a given plugin.
This method should usually only be called internally by plugins themselves
to keep track of internal state.  Because the content can be used arbitrarily
by the owning plugin because it is private to the plugin, and thus is not
part of the Alien::Build spec.
.SS runtime_prop
.IX Subsection "runtime_prop"
.Vb 1
\& my $href = $build\->runtime_prop;
.Ve
.PP
Runtime properties are used during the install and runtime phases
(either under \f(CW\*(C`share\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR install).  This should include
anything that you will need to know to use the library or tool
during runtime, and shouldn't include anything that is no longer
relevant once the install process is complete.
.IP alien_build_version 4
.IX Item "alien_build_version"
The version of Alien::Build used to install the library or tool.
.IP alt 4
.IX Item "alt"
Alternate configurations.  If the alienized package has multiple
libraries this could be used to store the different compiler or
linker flags for each library.  Typically this will be set by a
plugin in the gather stage (for either share or system installs).
.IP cflags 4
.IX Item "cflags"
The compiler flags.  This is typically set by a plugin in the
gather stage (for either share or system installs).
.IP cflags_static 4
.IX Item "cflags_static"
The static compiler flags.  This is typically set by a plugin in the
gather stage (for either share or system installs).
.IP command 4
.IX Item "command"
The command name for tools where the name my differ from platform to
platform.  For example, the GNU version of make is usually \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR in
Linux and \f(CW\*(C`gmake\*(C'\fR on FreeBSD.  This is typically set by a plugin in the
gather stage (for either share or system installs).
.IP ffi_name 4
.IX Item "ffi_name"
The name DLL or shared object "name" to use when searching for dynamic
libraries at runtime.  This is passed into FFI::CheckLib, so if
your library is something like \f(CW\*(C`libarchive.so\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`archive.dll\*(C'\fR you
would set this to \f(CW\*(C`archive\*(C'\fR.  This may be a string or an array of
strings.  This is typically set by a plugin in the gather stage
(for either share or system installs).
.IP ffi_checklib 4
.IX Item "ffi_checklib"
This property contains two sub properties:
.RS 4
.IP ffi_checklib.share 4
.IX Item "ffi_checklib.share"
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp
Array of additional FFI::CheckLib flags to pass in to \f(CW\*(C`find_lib\*(C'\fR
for a \f(CW\*(C`share\*(C'\fR install.
.IP ffi_checklib.system 4
.IX Item "ffi_checklib.system"
Array of additional FFI::CheckLib flags to pass in to \f(CW\*(C`find_lib\*(C'\fR
for a \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR install.
.Sp
Among other things, useful for specifying the \f(CW\*(C`try_linker_script\*(C'\fR
flag:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& $build\->runtime_prop\->{ffi_checklib}\->{system} = [ try_linker_script => 1 ];

.IP inline_auto_include 4
.IX Item "inline_auto_include"
[version 2.53]
.Sp
This property is an array reference of C code that will be passed into
Inline::C to make sure that appropriate headers are automatically
included.  See "auto_include" in Inline::C for details.
.IP install_type 4
.IX Item "install_type"
The install type.  This is set by AB core after the

.RS 4
.IP system 4
.IX Item "system"

.IX Item "libs"
The library flags.  This is typically set by a plugin in the
gather stage (for either share or system installs).
.IP libs_static 4
.IX Item "libs_static"
The static library flags.  This is typically set by a plugin in the
gather stage (for either share or system installs).
.IP perl_module_version 4
.IX Item "perl_module_version"
The version of the Perl module used to install the alien (if available).
For example if Alien::curl is installing \f(CW\*(C`libcurl\*(C'\fR this would be the
version of Alien::curl used during the install step.
.IP prefix 4
.IX Item "prefix"
The final install root.  This is usually they share directory.
.IP version 4
.IX Item "version"
The version of the library or tool.  This is typically set by a plugin in the
gather stage (for either share or system installs).
.SS hook_prop
.IX Subsection "hook_prop"
.Vb 1
\& my $href = $build\->hook_prop;
.Ve
.PP
Hook properties are for the currently running (if any) hook.  They are
used only during the execution of each hook and are discarded after.
If no hook is currently running then \f(CW\*(C`hook_prop\*(C'\fR will return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.IP name 4
.IX Item "name"
The name of the currently running hook.
.IP "version (probe)" 4
.IX Item "version (probe)"
Probe and PkgConfig plugins \fImay\fR set this property indicating the
version of the alienized package.  Not all plugins and configurations
may be able to provide this.
.IP "probe_class (probe)" 4
.IX Item "probe_class (probe)"
Probe and PkgConfig plugins \fImay\fR set this property indicating the
plugin class that made the probe.  If the probe results in a system
install this will be propagated to \f(CW\*(C`system_probe_class\*(C'\fR for later
use.
.IP "probe_instance_id (probe)" 4
.IX Item "probe_instance_id (probe)"
Probe and PkgConfig plugins \fImay\fR set this property indicating the
plugin instance id that made the probe.  If the probe results in a
system install this will be propagated to \f(CW\*(C`system_probe_instance_id\*(C'\fR
for later use.
.SH METHODS
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS checkpoint
.IX Subsection "checkpoint"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->checkpoint;
.Ve
.PP
Save any install or runtime properties so that they can be reloaded on
a subsequent run in a separate process.  This is useful if your build
needs to be done in multiple stages from a \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR, such as with
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Once checkpointed you can use the \f(CW\*(C`resume\*(C'\fR
constructor (documented above) to resume the probe/build/install]
process.
.SS root
.IX Subsection "root"
.Vb 1
\& my $dir = $build\->root;
.Ve
.PP
This is just a shortcut for:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $root = $build\->install_prop\->{root};
.Ve
.PP
Except that it will be created if it does not already exist.
.SS install_type
.IX Subsection "install_type"
.Vb 1
\& my $type = $build\->install_type;
.Ve

.PP
This returns install rule as a string.  This is determined by the environment
and should be one of:
.ie n .IP """warn""" 4
.el .IP \f(CWwarn\fR 4
.IX Item "warn"
Warn only if fetching via non secure source (secure sources include \f(CW\*(C`https\*(C'\fR,

.ie n .IP """digest""" 4
.el .IP \f(CWdigest\fR 4
.IX Item "digest"

the alienfile and that signature matches what was downloaded.
.ie n .IP """encrypt""" 4
.el .IP \f(CWencrypt\fR 4
.IX Item "encrypt"
Require that any downloaded source package is fetched via secure source.
.ie n .IP """digest_or_encrypt""" 4
.el .IP \f(CWdigest_or_encrypt\fR 4
.IX Item "digest_or_encrypt"
Require that any downloaded source package is \fBeither\fR fetched via a secure source

what was downloaded.
.ie n .IP """digest_and_encrypt""" 4
.el .IP \f(CWdigest_and_encrypt\fR 4
.IX Item "digest_and_encrypt"
Require that any downloaded source package is \fBboth\fR fetched via a secure source
\&\fBand\fR has a cryptographic signature in the alienfile and that signature matches
what was downloaded.
.PP
The current default is \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR, but in the near future this will be upgraded to
\&\f(CW\*(C`digest_or_encrypt\*(C'\fR.
.SS set_prefix
.IX Subsection "set_prefix"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->set_prefix($prefix);
.Ve
.PP
Set the final (unstaged) prefix.  This is normally only called by Alien::Build::MM
and similar modules.  It is not intended for use from plugins or from an alienfile.
.SS set_stage
.IX Subsection "set_stage"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->set_stage($dir);
.Ve
.PP
Sets the stage directory.  This is normally only called by Alien::Build::MM
and similar modules.  It is not intended for use from plugins or from an alienfile.
.SS requires
.IX Subsection "requires"
.Vb 1
\& my $hash = $build\->requires($phase);
.Ve
.PP
Returns a hash reference of the modules required for the given phase.  Phases
include:
.IP configure 4
.IX Item "configure"
These modules must already be available when the alienfile is read.
.IP any 4
.IX Item "any"
These modules are used during either a \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`share\*(C'\fR install.
.IP share 4
.IX Item "share"
These modules are used during the build phase of a \f(CW\*(C`share\*(C'\fR install.
.IP system 4
.IX Item "system"
These modules are used during the build phase of a \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR install.
.SS load_requires
.IX Subsection "load_requires"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->load_requires($phase);
.Ve
.PP
This loads the appropriate modules for the given phase (see \f(CW\*(C`requires\*(C'\fR above
for a description of the phases).
.SS probe
.IX Subsection "probe"
.Vb 1
\& my $install_type = $build\->probe;
.Ve
.PP
Attempts to determine if the operating system has the library or
tool already installed.  If so, then the string \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR will
be returned and a system install will be performed.  If not,
then the string \f(CW\*(C`share\*(C'\fR will be installed and the tool or
library will be downloaded and built from source.
.PP
If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE\*(C'\fR is set, then that
will force a specific type of install.  If the detection logic
cannot accommodate the install type requested then it will fail with
an exception.
.SS download
.IX Subsection "download"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->download;
.Ve
.PP
Download the source, usually as a tarball, usually from the internet.
.PP
Under a \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR install this does not do anything.
.SS fetch
.IX Subsection "fetch"
.Vb 2
\& my $res = $build\->fetch;
\& my $res = $build\->fetch($url, %options);
.Ve
.PP
Fetch a resource using the fetch hook.  Returns the same hash structure
described below in the
fetch hook documentation.
.PP
[version 2.39]
.PP
As of Alien::Build 2.39, these options are supported:
.IP http_headers 4
.IX Item "http_headers"
.Vb 1
\& my $res = $build\->fetch($url, http_headers => [ $key1 => $value1, $key2 => $value 2, ... ]);
.Ve
.Sp

do not \fIshould\fR issue a warning if you try to set request headers and they
are not supported.
.SS check_digest
.IX Subsection "check_digest"
[experimental]
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $bool = $build\->check_digest($path);

.IP string 4
.IX Item "string"
Containing the path to the file to be checked.
.IP Path::Tiny 4
.IX Item "Path::Tiny"
Containing the path to the file to be checked.
.ie n .IP """HASH""" 4
.el .IP \f(CWHASH\fR 4
.IX Item "HASH"
A Hash reference containing information about a file.  See
the fetch hook for details
on the format.
.PP
Returns true if the cryptographic signature matches, false if cryptographic
signatures are disabled.  Will throw an exception if the signature does not
match, or if no plugin provides the correct algorithm for checking the
signature.
.SS decode
.IX Subsection "decode"
.Vb 1
\& my $decoded_res = $build\->decode($res);
.Ve
.PP
Decode the HTML or file listing returned by \f(CW\*(C`fetch\*(C'\fR.  Returns the same
hash structure described below in the
decode hook documentation.
.SS prefer
.IX Subsection "prefer"
.Vb 1
\& my $sorted_res = $build\->prefer($res);
.Ve
.PP
Filter and sort candidates.  The preferred candidate will be returned first in the list.
The worst candidate will be returned last.  Returns the same hash structure described
below in the
prefer hook documentation.
.SS extract
.IX Subsection "extract"
.Vb 2
\& my $dir = $build\->extract;
\& my $dir = $build\->extract($archive);
.Ve
.PP
Extracts the given archive into a fresh directory.  This is normally called internally
to Alien::Build, and for normal usage is not needed from a plugin or alienfile.
.SS build
.IX Subsection "build"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->build;
.Ve
.PP
Run the build step.  It is expected that \f(CW\*(C`probe\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`download\*(C'\fR
have already been performed.  What it actually does depends on the
type of install:
.IP share 4
.IX Item "share"
The source is extracted, and built as determined by the alienfile
recipe.  If there is a \f(CW\*(C`gather_share\*(C'\fR that will be executed last.
.IP system 4
.IX Item "system"
The
gather_system hook
will be executed.
.SS test
.IX Subsection "test"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->test;
.Ve
.PP
Run the test phase
.SS clean_install
.IX Subsection "clean_install"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->clean_install
.Ve
.PP
Clean files from the final install location.  The default implementation removes all
files recursively except for the \f(CW\*(C`_alien\*(C'\fR directory.  This is helpful when you have
an old install with files that may break the new build.
.PP
For a non-share install this doesn't do anything.
.SS system
.IX Subsection "system"
.Vb 2
\& $build\->system($command);
\& $build\->system($command, @args);
.Ve
.PP
Interpolates the command and arguments and run the results using
the Perl \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR command.
.SS log
.IX Subsection "log"
.Vb 1
\& $build\->log($message);
.Ve
.PP
Send a message to the log.  By default this prints to \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR.
.SS meta
.IX Subsection "meta"
.Vb 2
\& my $meta = Alien::Build\->meta;
\& my $meta = $build\->meta;
.Ve
.PP
Returns the meta object for your Alien::Build class or instance.  The
meta object is a way to manipulate the recipe, and so any changes to the
meta object should be made before the \f(CW\*(C`probe\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`download\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`build\*(C'\fR steps.
.SH "META METHODS"
.IX Header "META METHODS"
.SS prop
.IX Subsection "prop"
.Vb 1
\& my $href = $build\->meta\->prop;
.Ve
.PP
Meta properties.  This is the same as calling \f(CW\*(C`meta_prop\*(C'\fR on
the class or Alien::Build instance.
.SS add_requires
.IX Subsection "add_requires"
.Vb 1
\& Alien::Build\->meta\->add_requires($phase, $module => $version, ...);

.SS interpolator
.IX Subsection "interpolator"
.Vb 2
\& my $interpolator = $build\->meta\->interpolator;
\& my $interpolator = Alien::Build\->interpolator;
.Ve
.PP
Returns the Alien::Build::Interpolate instance for the Alien::Build class.
.SS has_hook
.IX Subsection "has_hook"

.Vb 2
\& $build\->meta\->register_hook($name, $instructions);
\& Alien::Build\->meta\->register_hook($name, $instructions);
.Ve
.PP
Register a hook with the given name.  \f(CW$instruction\fR should be either
a code reference, or a command sequence, which is an array reference.
.SS default_hook
.IX Subsection "default_hook"
.Vb 2
\& $build\->meta\->default_hook($name, $instructions);
\& Alien::Build\->meta\->default_hook($name, $instructions);
.Ve
.PP
Register a default hook, which will be used if the alienfile does not
register its own hook with that name.
.SS around_hook
.IX Subsection "around_hook"
.Vb 2
\& $build\->meta\->around_hook($hook_name, $code);
\& Alien::Build\->meta\->around_hook($hook_name, $code);
.Ve
.PP
Wrap the given hook with a code reference.  This is similar to a Moose
method modifier, except that it wraps around the given hook instead of
a method.  For example, this will add a probe system requirement:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& $build\->meta\->around_hook(
\&   probe => sub {
\&     my $orig = shift;
\&     my $build = shift;
\&     my $type = $orig\->($build, @_);
\&     return $type unless $type eq \*(Aqsystem\*(Aq;
\&     # also require a configuration file
\&     if(\-f \*(Aq/etc/foo.conf\*(Aq)
\&     {
\&       return \*(Aqsystem\*(Aq;
\&     }
\&     else

\& });
.Ve
.PP
Execute the given code reference after the hook.  The original
arguments are passed into the code reference.
.SS before_hook
.IX Subsection "before_hook"
.Vb 4
\& $build\->meta\->before_hook($hook_name, sub {
\&   my(@args) = @_;

.Ve
.PP
Execute the given code reference before the hook.  The original
arguments are passed into the code reference.
.SS apply_plugin
.IX Subsection "apply_plugin"
.Vb 2
\& Alien::Build\->meta\->apply_plugin($name);
\& Alien::Build\->meta\->apply_plugin($name, @args);
.Ve
.PP
Apply the given plugin with the given arguments.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
Alien::Build responds to these environment variables:
.IP ALIEN_BUILD_LOG 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_BUILD_LOG"
The default log class used.  See Alien::Build::Log and Alien::Build::Log::Default.
.IP ALIEN_BUILD_PKG_CONFIG 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_BUILD_PKG_CONFIG"
Override the logic in Alien::Build::Plugin::PkgConfig::Negotiate which
chooses the best \f(CW\*(C`pkg\-config\*(C'\fR plugin.
.IP ALIEN_BUILD_POSTLOAD 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_BUILD_POSTLOAD"
semicolon separated list of plugins to automatically load after parsing
your alienfile.
.IP ALIEN_BUILD_PRELOAD 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_BUILD_PRELOAD"
semicolon separated list of plugins to automatically load before parsing
your alienfile.
.IP ALIEN_BUILD_RC 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_BUILD_RC"
Perl source file which can override some global defaults for Alien::Build,
by, for example, setting preload and postload plugins.
.IP ALIEN_DOWNLOAD_RULE 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_DOWNLOAD_RULE"
This value determines the rules by which types of downloads are allowed.  The legal
values listed under "download_rule", plus \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR which will be the default for
the current version of Alien::Build.  For this version that default is \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR.
.IP ALIEN_INSTALL_NETWORK 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_INSTALL_NETWORK"
If set to true (the default), then network fetch will be allowed.  If set to
false, then network fetch will not be allowed.
.Sp
What constitutes a local vs. network fetch is determined based on the \f(CW\*(C`start_url\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`local_source\*(C'\fR meta properties.  An alienfile or plugin \f(CW\*(C`could\*(C'\fR override
this detection (possibly inappropriately), so this variable is not a substitute
for properly auditing of Perl modules for environments that require that.
.IP ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE 4
.IX Item "ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE"
If set to \f(CW\*(C`share\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR, it will override the system detection logic.
If set to \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR, it will use the default setting for the alienfile.
The behavior of other values is undefined.
.Sp
Although the recommended way for a consumer to use an Alien::Base based Alien
is to declare it as a static configure and build-time dependency, some consumers
may prefer to fallback on using an Alien only when the consumer itself cannot
detect the necessary package. In some cases the consumer may want the user to opt-in
to using an Alien before requiring it.
.Sp
To keep the interface consistent among Aliens, the consumer of the fallback opt-in
Alien may fallback on the Alien if the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE\*(C'\fR
is set to any value. The rationale is that by setting this environment variable the
user is aware that Alien modules may be installed and have indicated consent.
The actual implementation of this, by its nature would have to be in the consuming
CPAN module.
.IP DESTDIR 4
.IX Item "DESTDIR"
This environment variable will be manipulated during a destdir install.
.IP PKG_CONFIG 4
.IX Item "PKG_CONFIG"
This environment variable can be used to override the program name for \f(CW\*(C`pkg\-config\*(C'\fR
when using the command line plugin: Alien::Build::Plugin::PkgConfig::CommandLine.
.IP "ftp_proxy, all_proxy" 4
.IX Item "ftp_proxy, all_proxy"
If these environment variables are set, it may influence the Download negotiation
plugin Alien::Build::Plugin::Download::Negotiate.  Other proxy variables may
be used by some Fetch plugins, if they support it.
.SH SUPPORT
.IX Header "SUPPORT"

Alien::Base was originally written by Joel Berger, the rest of this project would
not have been possible without him getting the project started.  Thanks to his support
I have been able to augment the original Alien::Base system with a reliable set
of tools (Alien::Build, alienfile, Test::Alien), which make up this toolset.
.PP
The original Alien::Base is still copyright (c) 2012\-2020 Joel Berger.  It has
the same license as the rest of the Alien::Build and related tools distributed as
\&\f(CW\*(C`Alien\-Build\*(C'\fR.  Joel Berger thanked a number of people who helped in in the development
of Alien::Base, in the documentation for that module.
.PP
I would also like to acknowledge the other members of the PerlAlien github
organization, Zakariyya Mughal (sivoais, ZMUGHAL) and mohawk (ETJ).  Also important
in the early development of Alien::Build were the early adopters Chase Whitener
(genio, CAPOEIRAB, author of Alien::libuv), William N. Braswell, Jr (willthechill,
WBRASWELL, author of Alien::JPCRE2 and Alien::PCRE2) and Ahmad Fatoum (a3f,
ATHREEF, author of Alien::libudev and Alien::LibUSB).

The Alien ecosystem owes a debt to Dan Book, who goes by Grinnz on IRC, for answering
question about how to use Alien::Build and friends.
