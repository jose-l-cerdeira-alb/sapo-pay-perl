.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module parses the Olson database time zone definition files and creates
various objects representing time zone data.
.PP
Each time zone is broken down into several parts.  The first piece is an
observance, which is an offset from UTC and an abbreviation.  A single zone may
contain many observances, reflecting historical changes in that time zone over
time.  An observance may also refer to a set of rules.
.PP
Rules are named, and may apply to many different zones.  For example, the "US"
rules apply to most of the time zones in the US, unsurprisingly.  Rules are
made of an offset from standard time and a definition of when that offset
changes.  Changes can be a one time thing, or they can recur at regular times
through a span of years.
.PP
Each rule may have an associated letter, which is used to generate an
abbreviated name for the time zone, along with the offset's abbreviation.  For
example, if the offset's abbreviation is "C%sT", and the a rule specifies the
letter "S", then the abbreviation when that rule is in effect is "CST".
