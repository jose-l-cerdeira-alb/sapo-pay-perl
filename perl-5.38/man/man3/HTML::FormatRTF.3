.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
HTML::FormatRTF is a class for objects that you use to convert HTML to RTF.
There is currently no proper support for tables or forms.
.PP
This is a subclass of HTML::Formatter, whose documentation you should
consult for more information on underlying methods such as \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`format_file\*(C'\fR etc
.PP
You can specify any of the following parameters in the call to \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`format_file\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`format_string\*(C'\fR:
.IP lm 4
.IX Item "lm"
Amount of \fIextra\fR indenting to apply to the left margin, in twips
(\fItw\fRent\fIi\fReths of a \fIp\fRoint). Default is 0.
.Sp
So if you wanted the left margin to be an additional half inch larger, you'd
set \f(CW\*(C`lm => 720\*(C'\fR (since there's 1440 twips in an inch). If you wanted it to
be about 1.5cm larger, you'd set \f(CW\*(C`lw => 850\*(C'\fR (since there's about 567
twips in a centimeter).
.IP rm 4
.IX Item "rm"
Amount of \fIextra\fR indenting to apply to the left margin, in twips
(\fItw\fRent\fIi\fReths of a \fIp\fRoint).  Default is 0.
.IP normal_halfpoint_size 4
.IX Item "normal_halfpoint_size"
This is the size of normal text in the document, in \fIhalf\fR\-points. The default
value is 22, meaning that normal text is in 11 point.
.IP header_halfpoint_size 4
.IX Item "header_halfpoint_size"
This is the size of text used in the document's page-header, in \fIhalf\fR\-points.
The default value is 17, meaning that normal text is in 7.5 point.  Currently,
the header consists just of "p. \fIpagenumber\fR" in the upper-right-hand corner,
and cannot be disabled.
.IP "head1_halfpoint_size ... head6_halfpoint_size" 4
.IX Item "head1_halfpoint_size ... head6_halfpoint_size"
These control the font size of each heading level, in half-twips.  For example,
the default for head3_halfpoint_size is 25, meaning that HTML \f(CW\*(C`<h3>...</h3>\*(C'\fR text will be in 12.5 point text (in addition to being underlined and in the
heading font).
.IP codeblock_halfpoint_size 4
.IX Item "codeblock_halfpoint_size"
This controls the font size (in half-points) of the text used for \f(CW\*(C`<pre>...</pre>\*(C'\fR text.  By default, it is 18, meaning 9 point.
.IP fontname_body 4
.IX Item "fontname_body"
This option controls what font is to be used for the body of the text \-\- that
is, everything other than heading text and text in pre/code/tt elements. The
default value is currently "Times".  Other handy values I can suggest using are
"Georgia" or "Bookman Old Style".
.IP fontname_code 4
.IX Item "fontname_code"
This option controls what font is to be used for text in pre/code/tt elements.
The default value is currently "Courier New".
.IP fontname_headings 4
.IX Item "fontname_headings"
This option controls what font name is to be used for headings.  You can use
the same font as fontname_body, but I prefer a sans-serif font, so the default
value is currently "Arial".  Also consider "Tahoma" and "Verdana".
.IP document_language 4
.IX Item "document_language"
This option controls what Microsoft language number will be specified as the
language for this document. The current default value is 1033, for US English.
Consult an RTF reference for other language numbers.
.IP hr_width 4
.IX Item "hr_width"
This option controls how many underline characters will be used for rendering a
"<hr>" tag. Its default value is currently 50. You can usually leave this
alone, but under some circumstances you might want to use a smaller or larger
number.
.IP no_prolog 4
.IX Item "no_prolog"
If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatRTF will make a point of
\&\fInot\fR emitting the RTF prolog before the document.  By default, this is off,
meaning that HTML::FormatRTF \fIwill\fR emit the prolog.  This option is of
interest only to advanced users.
.IP no_trailer 4
.IX Item "no_trailer"
If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatRTF will make a point of
\&\fInot\fR emitting the RTF trailer at the end of the document.  By default, this
is off, meaning that HTML::FormatRTF \fIwill\fR emit the bit of RTF that ends the
document.  This option is of interest only to advanced users.
