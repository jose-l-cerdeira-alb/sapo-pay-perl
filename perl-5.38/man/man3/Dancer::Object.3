.SH SYNOPSIS

.Vb 1
\&    package My::Dancer::Extension;
\&
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;

\&
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->attributes( qw/name value this that/ );

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
While we \fBlove\fR Moose, we can't use it for Dancer and still keep Dancer
minimal, so we wrote Dancer::Object instead.
.PP
It provides you with attributes and an initializer.
.SH METHODS
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS new
.IX Subsection "new"
Creates a new object of whatever is based off Dancer::Object. This is a generic
\&\f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method so you don't have to write one yourself when extending
\&\f(CW\*(C`Dancer::Object\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts arguments in a hash and runs an additional \f(CW\*(C`init\*(C'\fR method (described
below) which you should implement.
.SS init
.IX Subsection "init"
Exists but does nothing. This is so you won't have to write an initializer if
you don't want to.
.SS clone
.IX Subsection "clone"
Creates and returns a clone of the object using Clone, which is loaded
dynamically. If we cannot load Clone, we throw an exception.
.SS get_attributes
.IX Subsection "get_attributes"
Get the attributes of the specific class.
.SS attributes
.IX Subsection "attributes"
Generates attributes for whatever object is extending Dancer::Object and saves
them in an internal hashref so they can be later fetched using
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_attributes\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For each defined attribute you can access its value using:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $self\->your_attribute_name;
.Ve
.PP
To set a value use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $self\->your_attribute_name($value);
.Ve
.PP
Nevertheless, you can continue to use these attributes as hash keys,
as usual with blessed hash references:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $self\->{your_attribute_name} = $value;
.Ve
.PP
Although this is possible we defend you should use the method
approach, as it maintains compatibility in case \f(CW\*(C`Dancer::Object\*(C'\fR
structure changes in the future.
.SS attributes_defaults
.IX Subsection "attributes_defaults"
.Vb 1
\&  $self\->attributes_defaults(length => 2);
.Ve
.PP
given a hash (not a hashref), makes sure an object has the given attributes
default values. Usually called from within an \f(CW\*(C`init\*(C'\fR function.
