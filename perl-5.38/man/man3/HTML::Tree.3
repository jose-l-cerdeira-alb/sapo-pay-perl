.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
HTML-Tree is a suite of Perl modules for making parse trees out of
HTML source.  It consists of mainly two modules, whose documentation
you should refer to: HTML::TreeBuilder
and HTML::Element.
.PP
HTML::TreeBuilder is the module that builds the parse trees.  (It uses
HTML::Parser to do the work of breaking the HTML up into tokens.)
.PP
The tree that TreeBuilder builds for you is made up of objects of the
class HTML::Element.
.PP
If you find that you do not properly understand the documentation
for HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element, it may be because you are
unfamiliar with tree-shaped data structures, or with object-oriented
modules in general. Sean Burke has written some articles for
\&\fIThe Perl Journal\fR (\f(CW\*(C`www.tpj.com\*(C'\fR) that seek to provide that background.
The full text of those articles is contained in this distribution, as:
.IP HTML::Tree::AboutObjects 4
.IX Item "HTML::Tree::AboutObjects"
"User's View of Object-Oriented Modules" from TPJ17.
.IP HTML::Tree::AboutTrees 4
.IX Item "HTML::Tree::AboutTrees"
"Trees" from TPJ18
.IP HTML::Tree::Scanning 4
.IX Item "HTML::Tree::Scanning"
"Scanning HTML" from TPJ19
.PP
Readers already familiar with object-oriented modules and tree-shaped
data structures should read just the last article.  Readers without
that background should read the first, then the second, and then the
third.
.SH METHODS
.IX Header "METHODS"
All these methods simply redirect to the corresponding method in
HTML::TreeBuilder.  It's more efficient to use HTML::TreeBuilder
directly, and skip loading HTML::Tree at all.
.SS new
.IX Subsection "new"
Redirects to "new" in HTML::TreeBuilder.
.SS new_from_file
.IX Subsection "new_from_file"
Redirects to "new_from_file" in HTML::TreeBuilder.
.SS new_from_content
.IX Subsection "new_from_content"
Redirects to "new_from_content" in HTML::TreeBuilder.
.SS new_from_url
.IX Subsection "new_from_url"
Redirects to "new_from_url" in HTML::TreeBuilder.
