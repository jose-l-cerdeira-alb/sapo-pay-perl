.SH NAME
Pod::Coverage::TrustPod \- allow a module's pod to contain Pod::Coverage hints
.SH VERSION
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.100006
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a Pod::Coverage subclass (actually, a subclass of
Pod::Coverage::CountParents) that allows the POD itself to declare certain
symbol names trusted.
.PP
Here is a sample Perl module:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  package Foo::Bar;
\&
\&  =head1 NAME
\&
\&  Foo::Bar \- a bar at which fooes like to drink
\&
\&  =head1 METHODS
\&
\&  =head2 fee
\&
\&  returns the bar tab
\&
\&  =cut
\&
\&  sub fee { ... }
\&
\&  =head2 fie
\&
\&  scoffs at bar tab
\&
\&  =cut
\&
\&  sub fie { ... }
\&
\&  sub foo { ... }
\&
\&  =begin Pod::Coverage
\&
\&    foo
\&
\&  =end Pod::Coverage
\&
\&  =cut
.Ve
.PP
This file would report full coverage, because any non-empty lines inside a
block of POD targeted to Pod::Coverage are treated as \f(CW\*(C`trustme\*(C'\fR patterns.
Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped and the remainder is treated as a
regular expression anchored at both ends.
.PP
Remember, anywhere you could use \f(CW\*(C`=begin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`=end\*(C'\fR as above, you could
instead write:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  =for Pod::Coverage foo
.Ve
.PP
In some cases, you may wish to make the entire file trusted.  The special
pattern \f(CW\*(C`*EVERYTHING*\*(C'\fR may be provided to do just this.
.PP
Keep in mind that Pod::Coverage::TrustPod sets up exceptions using the "trust"
mechanism rather than the "privacy" mechanism in Pod::Coverage.  This is
unlikely ever to matter to you, but it's true.
.SH "PERL VERSION"
.IX Header "PERL VERSION"
This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work
on any version of perl released in the last five years.
.PP
Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower
the minimum required perl.
