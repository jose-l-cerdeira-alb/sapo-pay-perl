Net::SSH::Perl::Kex \- SSH2 Key Exchange
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"

\&    use Net::SSH::Perl::Kex;
\&    my $kex = Net::SSH::Perl::Kex\->new($ssh);
\&    $kex\->exchange;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fINet::SSH::Perl::Kex\fR implements base functionality for SSH2
key exchange. The basic idea is this: Kex itself initializes
the client algorithm proposal, sends it to the server, then
waits for the server's proposal. From these proposals Kex
chooses the algorithms that will be used in the communications
between client and server (eg. encryption algorithm, MAC
algorithm, etc.). Different algorithms can be used in each
direction; for example, client to server communications could
be encrypted using 3DES, and server to client could be encrypted
using RC4.
.PP
The algorithm negotiation phase, as described above, includes
negotiation for the key-exchange algorithm to be used.
After algorithm negotiation, the Kex object is reblessed into
the key exchange class (eg. 'Net::SSH::Perl::Kex::DH1'), and
then the subclass's \fIexchange\fR method is called to perform
the key exchange.
.PP
Once control returns to Kex::exchange, the client waits for
the \fISSH_MSG_NEWKEYS\fR message; once received, the client
turns on its incoming encryption/MAC/compression algorithms,
then sends an \fISSH_MSG_NEWKEYS\fR message to the server.
Finally, it turns on its outgoing encryption/MAC/compression
algorithms.
