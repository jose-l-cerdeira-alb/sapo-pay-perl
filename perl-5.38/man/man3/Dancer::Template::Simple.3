.SH NAME
Dancer::Template::Simple \- pure Perl 5 template engine for Dancer
.SH VERSION
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 1.3521
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This template engine is provided as a default one for the Dancer micro
framework.
.PP
This template engine should be fine for development purposes but is not a
powerful one, it's written in pure Perl and has no C bindings to accelerate the
template processing.
.PP
If you want to power an application with Dancer in production environment, it's
strongly advised to switch to Dancer::Template::TemplateToolkit.
.SH SYNTAX
.IX Header "SYNTAX"
A template written for Dancer::Template::Simple should be working just fine with
Dancer::Template::TemplateToolkit. The opposite is not true though.
.IP \fBvariables\fR 4
.IX Item "variables"
To interpolate a variable in the template, use the following syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    <% var1 %>
.Ve
.Sp
If 'var1' exists in the tokens hash given, its value will be written there.
