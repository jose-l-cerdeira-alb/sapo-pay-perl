.SH NAME
AnyEvent::Impl::FLTK \- AnyEvent adaptor for FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit version two)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides transparent support for AnyEvent. You don't have to
do anything to make FLTK work with AnyEvent except by loading FLTK before
creating the first AnyEvent watcher.
.PP
This implementation is not to be confused with AnyEvent::Impl::FLTK by
Sanko Robinson. That implementation is completely broken, and the author
is apparently unreachable.
.PP
In any case, FLTK suffers from typical GUI-ToolKit diseases, such as O(n)
or worse for every operation (adding a timer, destroying a timer etc.),
the typical Not-Well-Tested Perl Interface disases such as non-random
memory corruption and the typical Event-Loop-as-an-Afterthrough issues,
such as multiple watchers on the same fd silently overwriting the others.
.PP
It doesn't have native idle, signal or child watchers, so all of these are
emulated.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
AnyEvent, FLTK.
