.SH NAME
Type::Tiny::XS \- provides an XS boost for some of Type::Tiny's built\-in type constraints
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&   use Types::Standard qw(Int);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module is optionally used by Type::Tiny 0.045_03 and above
to provide faster, C\-based implementations of some type constraints.
(This package has only core dependencies, and does not depend on
Type::Tiny, so other data validation frameworks might also consider
using it!)
.PP
Only the following three functions should be considered part of the
supported API:
.ie n .IP Type::Tiny::XS::get_coderef_for($type) 4
.el .IP \f(CWType::Tiny::XS::get_coderef_for($type)\fR 4
.IX Item "Type::Tiny::XS::get_coderef_for($type)"
Given a supported type constraint name, such as \f(CW"Int"\fR, returns
a coderef that can be used to validate a parameter against this
constraint.
.Sp
Returns undef if this module cannot provide a suitable coderef.
.ie n .IP Type::Tiny::XS::get_subname_for($type) 4
.el .IP \f(CWType::Tiny::XS::get_subname_for($type)\fR 4
.IX Item "Type::Tiny::XS::get_subname_for($type)"
Like \f(CW\*(C`get_coderef_for\*(C'\fR but returns the name of such a sub as a string.
.Sp
Returns undef if this module cannot provide a suitable sub name.
.ie n .IP Type::Tiny::XS::is_known($coderef) 4
.el .IP \f(CWType::Tiny::XS::is_known($coderef)\fR 4
.IX Item "Type::Tiny::XS::is_known($coderef)"
Returns true if the coderef was provided by Type::Tiny::XS.
.PP
In addition to the above functions, the subs returned by
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_coderef_for\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`get_subname_for\*(C'\fR are considered part of the
"supported API", but only for the lifetime of the Perl process that
returned them.
.PP
To clarify, if you call \f(CWget_subname_for("ArrayRef[Int]")\fR in a
script, this will return the name of a sub. That sub (which can be used
to validate arrayrefs of integers) is now considered part of the
supported API of Type::Tiny::XS until the script finishes running. Next
time the script runs, there is no guarantee that the sub will continue
to exist, or continue to do the same thing.
