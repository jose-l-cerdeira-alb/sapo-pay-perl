.SH NAME
Net::SSH::Perl::Constants \- Exportable constants
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    use Net::SSH::Perl::Constants qw( constants );
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fINet::SSH::Perl::Constants\fR provides a list of common and
useful constants for use in communicating with an sshd
server, etc.
.PP
None of the constants are exported by default; you have to
explicitly ask for them. Some of the constants are grouped
into bundles that you can grab all at once, or you can just
take the individual constants, one by one.
.PP
If you wish to import a group, your \fIuse\fR statement should
look something like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Net::SSH::Perl::Constants qw( :group );
.Ve
.PP
Here are the groups:
.IP \(bu 4
msg
.Sp
All of the MSG constants. In the SSH packet layer protocol,
each packet is identified by its type; for example, you have
a packet type for starting RSA authentication, a different
type for sending a command, etc. The MSG constants are used
when creating a new packet, then:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $packet = $ssh\->packet_start( I<msg_constant> );
.Ve
.Sp
See the \fINet::SSH::Perl::Packet\fR and \fINet::SSH::Perl\fR docs
for details.
.Sp
\&\fINet::SSH::Perl\fR doesn't support all of the features of
the ssh client, so it doesn't need all of its MSG
constants. For a full list of such constants, and an
explanation of each, see the SSH RFC.
.Sp
Here's the list of MSG constants supported by \fINet::SSH::Perl\fR:
SSH_MSG_NONE, SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT, SSH_SMSG_PUBLIC_KEY,
SSH_CMSG_SESSION_KEY, SSH_CMSG_USER, SSH_CMSG_AUTH_RHOSTS,
SSH_CMSG_AUTH_RSA, SSH_SMSG_AUTH_RSA_CHALLENGE,
SSH_CMSG_AUTH_RSA_RESPONSE, SSH_CMSG_AUTH_PASSWORD,
SSH_CMSG_EXEC_SHELL, SSH_CMSG_EXEC_CMD, SSH_SMSG_SUCCESS,
SSH_SMSG_FAILURE, SSH_CMSG_STDIN_DATA, SSH_SMSG_STDOUT_DATA,
SSH_SMSG_STDERR_DATA, SSH_CMSG_EOF, SSH_SMSG_EXITSTATUS,
SSH_MSG_IGNORE, SSH_CMSG_EXIT_CONFIRMATION,
SSH_CMSG_AUTH_RHOSTS_RSA, SSH_MSG_DEBUG,
SSH_CMSG_REQUEST_COMPRESSION.
.IP \(bu 4
hosts
.Sp
The HOST constants: HOST_OK, HOST_NEW, and HOST_CHANGED.
These are returned from the \f(CW\*(C`_check_host_in_hostfile\*(C'\fR
routine in \fINet::SSH::Perl::Util\fR. See those docs for
that routine for an explanation of the meaning of these
constants.
.IP \(bu 4
agent
.Sp
The AGENT constants, used when talking to an authentication
agent: SSH_AGENTC_REQUEST_RSA_IDENTITIES,
SSH_AGENT_RSA_IDENTITIES_ANSWER, SSH_AGENTC_RSA_CHALLENGE,
SSH_AGENT_RSA_RESPONSE, SSH_AGENT_FAILURE, SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS,
SSH2_AGENTC_REQUEST_IDENTITIES, SSH2_AGENT_IDENTITIES_ANSWER,
SSH2_AGENTC_SIGN_REQUEST, SSH2_AGENT_SIGN_RESPONSE.
.PP
Other exportable constants, not belonging to a group, are:
.IP \(bu 4
PROTOCOL_MAJOR
.IP \(bu 4
PROTOCOL_MINOR
.Sp
These two constants describe the version of the protocol
supported by this SSH client (ie., \fINet::SSH::Perl\fR).
They're used when identifying the client to the server
and vice versa.
.IP \(bu 4
PRIVATE_KEY_ID_STRING
.Sp
A special ID string written to private key files; if
the ID string in the file doesn't match this, we stop
reading the private key file.
.IP \(bu 4
MAX_PACKET_SIZE
.Sp
The maximum size of a packet in the packet layer.
