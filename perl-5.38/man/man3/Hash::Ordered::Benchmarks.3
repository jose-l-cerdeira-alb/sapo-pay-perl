Hash::Ordered::Benchmarks \- Ordered hash benchmarking
.SH VERSION
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.014
.SH INTRODUCTION
.IX Header "INTRODUCTION"
The Hash::Ordered internals are simple: a hash of data and an array of
ordered keys.  I thought this would perform well for common tasks and
likely outperform more complicated ordered hash implementations, so I
decided to do some benchmarking to test it.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: since the initial benchmarking, \f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR gained
just-in-time indexing of the keys array to support faster tombstone
deletion, which adds some conditional data structures to the internals.  It
also now supports \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR.  The revised benchmarks include the \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR mode
for comparison with other tied hash implementations.
.SH "MODULES TESTED"
.IX Header "MODULES TESTED"
In my review of alternatives to \f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR, six seemed sufficiently
general-purpose to be worth benchmarking.  The modules tested are listed in
the benchmark output in shorthand:
.IP \(bu 4
Array::AsHash — denoted \f(CW\*(C`a:ah\*(C'\fR
.IP \(bu 4
Array::OrdHash — denoted \f(CW\*(C`a:oh\*(C'\fR
.IP \(bu 4
Data::XHash — denoted \f(CW\*(C`d:xh\*(C'\fR
.IP \(bu 4
Hash::Ordered — denoted \f(CW\*(C`h:o\*(C'\fR and marked with "*"
.IP \(bu 4
Tie::Hash::Indexed — denoted \f(CW\*(C`t:h:i\*(C'\fR
.IP \(bu 4
Tie::IxHash — denoted \f(CW\*(C`t:ix\*(C'\fR
.IP \(bu 4
Tie::LLHash — denoted \f(CW\*(C`t:llh\*(C'\fR
.PP
Note that Tie::Hash::Indexed is written in XS and also may require
forced installation as its tests often fail for Perl 5.18+ due to the
hash randomization change.
.PP
If there are different methods of doing something with a module, the
variations are described in each section below.
.SH BENCHMARKS
.IX Header "BENCHMARKS"
I conducted benchmarking with the Benchmark module.  The test script is
in the \f(CW\*(C`devel\*(C'\fR directory of the distribution.  Tests were run on Perl
5.20.2 on a Mac Book Pro (darwin\-thread\-multi\-2level).  Each benchmark
ran for 5 CPU seconds.
.PP
Benchmarks were run at several different scales to reveal differences in
efficiency as hash size grows.  The details are described in each section
below.
.PP
A seed list of keys and values was generated from random integers
using Math::Random::MT::Auto.  The same seed list was used for
all benchmarks unless otherwise noted.
.PP
I did not test advanced features of these modules, as apples-to-apples
comparison is difficult.  Still, the performance on common, simple measures
could suggest how features that combine these operations might perform.
.SS "Ordered hash creation"
.IX Subsection "Ordered hash creation"
I tested hash creation for 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  For some modules
there were different options for creating a hash:
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Array::AsHash\*(C'\fR takes an array-reference with an option to use it directly or to clone it.  In one case I provided the seed list array reference with the clone option to true ("a:ah_cp").  In another case I created a new array reference from the seed list and provided it directly ("a:ah_rf").
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR can be initialized either with \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR ("h:o_oo") or via \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR ("h:o_th").
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Tie::IxHash\*(C'\fR can be initialized either with \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR ("t:ix_oo") or via \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR ("t:ix_th").
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Data::XHash\*(C'\fR can be created with a list ("t:xh_ls") or an array reference ("t:xh_rf").
.PP
As expected, when \f(CW\*(C`Array::AsHash\*(C'\fR gets an array reference, it's very fast.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Tie::Hash::Indexed\*(C'\fR does well here, also.  Of the non-XS, more hash-like
choices, \f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR does well.

.SS "Getting hash elements"
.IX Subsection "Getting hash elements"
I tested retrieving values for 10% of the keys, randomly selected, from
hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  The hash was created beforehand so
the benchmarks reflect only element access.
.PP
Some modules had choices for how to retrieve an value, usually between a
method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference
("_rf").
.PP
Generally, method calls turned out faster than other approaches for a given
module, demonstrating the inefficiency of tied objects.

.SS "Deleting hash elements"
.IX Subsection "Deleting hash elements"
I tested creating hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements and then deleting
10% of the keys, chosen randomly.  I would have liked to have isolated
creation from deletion, but I couldn't figure out a way to do that given
how \f(CW\*(C`Benchmark\*(C'\fR runs the same tests over and over.
.PP
Some modules had choices for how to delete a value, usually between a
method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference
("_rf").
.PP
The performance changes (or lack thereof) at the three different sizes
reveals implementation differences.  (Though recall that some of this is
the creation performance difference as well as deletion difference.)
.PP
For example, \f(CW\*(C`Tie::Hash::Indexed\*(C'\fR XS does very well, which could be its
good creation performance, but could also be good deletion.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR does linear search deleting a key for the 10 element hash,
but automatically switches to indexed, tombstone deletion for the larger
hashes.  When deleting only 10% of keys, garbage collection of tombstoned
keys never occurs, so that amortized cost is not included.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Tie::LLHash\*(C'\fR improves at larger sizes as deleting from a
linked list is faster than splicing out an element of an array.
Conversely, \f(CW\*(C`Array::AsHash\*(C'\fR just gets worse.

.IX Subsection "Extracting the hash as a list"
I tested getting an ordered list of pairs from hashes of 10, 100 and 1000
elements.  The hash was created beforehand so the benchmarks reflect only
conversion to a list.
.PP
Oddly, modules that usually have more than one way to do things don't for
this.  Even \f(CW\*(C`Tie::IxHash\*(C'\fR doesn't really have an OO way to do it, so I did
it longhand:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        @list = map { $_ => $tix_oo\->FETCH($_) } $tix_oo\->Keys;
.Ve
.PP
Because \f(CW\*(C`Array::AsHash\*(C'\fR keeps its internal representation as an ordered
list of pairs, it outperforms the rest handily as it merely needs to
dereference that data structure.

.SH CONCLUSION
.IX Header "CONCLUSION"
With the exception of hash creation and element deletion, \f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR
generally outperformed the other ordered hash implementations.  Even for
creation, it was the fastest of the pure-Perl, hash-based implementations,
often by a large margin.
.PP
In the original release of \f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR, deletion got worse as the hash
size grew.  The new JIT indexing with tombstones now makes deletion far
faster than any pure-Perl implementation.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Array::AsHash\*(C'\fR, with the opposite internal implementation compared to
\&\f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR, performs best at creation and listing pairs, but is dead
last at element access and modification.  I believe the poor performance is
mostly due to extra indirection (e.g. an extra function call) and logic in
the element access methods.  For uses that don't require much element
access and have lots of creation/serialization, it could still be a useful
choice.
.PP
Generally, every module that depends on \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR for some portion of its
implementation pays a substantial performance penalty.  Comparing
\&\f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR benchmarks with and without \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR for individual element
operations shows how severe this penalty can be.  \f(CW\*(C`Tie::Hash::Indexed\*(C'\fR —
likely because of its XS implementation — performs decently, but not well
enough in my opinion to justify its use.
.PP
As the author of \f(CW\*(C`Hash::Ordered\*(C'\fR, I'm clearly biased, but I think these
benchmarks make a very good case for it being the "go to" module for
pure-Perl, general-purpose ordered hashes.
