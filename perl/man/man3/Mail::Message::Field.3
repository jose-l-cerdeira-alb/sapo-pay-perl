(stringification) produces the unfolded body of the field, which may
be what you expect.  This is what makes what the field object seems
to be a simple string. The string is produced by \fIunfoldedBody()\fR.
.Sp
example:

Some fields are described in the RFCs as being \fIstructured\fR: having a
well described syntax.  These fields have common ideas about comments
and the like, what they do not share with unstructured fields, like
the \f(CW\*(C`Subject\*(C'\fR field.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 2

field's name, body and folding characters.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBnrLines\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBnrLines\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->nrLines()"

.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBprint\fR( [$fh] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBprint\fR( [$fh] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->print( [$fh] )"
Print the whole header-line to the specified file-handle. One line may
result in more than one printed line, because of the folding of long
lines.  The \f(CW$fh\fR defaults to the selected handle.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBsize\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBsize\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->size()"
Returns the number of bytes needed to display this header-line, Same
as \fIlength()\fR.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBstring\fR( [$wrap] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBstring\fR( [$wrap] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->string( [$wrap] )"
Returns the field as string.  By default, this returns the same as
\&\fIfolded()\fR. However, the optional \f(CW$wrap\fR will cause to re-fold to take
place (without changing the folding stored inside the field).
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBtoDisclose\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBtoDisclose\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->toDisclose()"
Returns whether this field can be disclosed to other people, for instance
when sending the message to an other party.  Returns a \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR
condition.
See also \fIMail::Message::Head::Complete::printUndisclosed()\fR.

.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBName\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBName\fR()" 4

.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBname\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBname\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->name()"
Returns the name of this field, with all characters lower-cased for
ease of comparison.  See \fIName()\fR as well.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBwellformedName\fR( [\s-1STRING\s0] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBwellformedName\fR( [\s-1STRING\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->wellformedName( [STRING] )"
(Instance method class method)
As instance method, the current field's name is correctly formatted
and returned.  When a \s-1STRING\s0 is used, that one is formatted.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& print Mail::Message::Field\->Name(\*(Aqcontent\-type\*(Aq)
\&   # \-\->  Content\-Type
\&
\& my $field = $head\->get(\*(Aqdate\*(Aq);

.SS "Access to the body"
.IX Subsection "Access to the body"
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBbody\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBbody\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->body()"
This method may be what you want, but usually, the \fIfoldedBody()\fR and
\&\fIunfoldedBody()\fR are what you are looking for.  This method is
cultural heritage, and should be avoided.
.Sp
Returns the body of the field.  When this field is structured, it will
be \fBstripped\fR from everything what is behind the first semi-color (\f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR).
In any case, the string is unfolded.  
Whether the field is structured is defined by \fIisStructured()\fR.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBfolded\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBfolded\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->folded()"
Returns the folded version of the whole header.  When the header is
shorter than the wrap length, a list of one line is returned.  Otherwise
more lines will be returned, all but the first starting with at least
one blank.  See also \fIfoldedBody()\fR to get the same information without
the field's name.
.Sp
In scalar context, the lines are delived into one string, which is
a little faster because that's the way they are stored internally...
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& my @lines = $field\->folded;
\& print $field\->folded;
\& print scalar $field\->folded; # faster
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBfoldedBody\fR( [$body] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBfoldedBody\fR( [$body] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->foldedBody( [$body] )"
Returns the body as a set of lines. In scalar context, this will be one line
containing newlines.  Be warned about the newlines when you do
pattern-matching on the result of thie method.
.Sp
The optional \f(CW$body\fR argument changes the field's body.  The folding of the
argument must be correct.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBstripCFWS\fR( [\s-1STRING\s0] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBstripCFWS\fR( [\s-1STRING\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->stripCFWS( [STRING] )"
.PD 0
.IP "Mail::Message::Field\->\fBstripCFWS\fR( [\s-1STRING\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "Mail::Message::Field->stripCFWS( [STRING] )"
.PD
Remove the \fIcomments\fR and \fIfolding white spaces\fR from the \s-1STRING\s0.  Without
string and only as instance method, the \fIunfoldedBody()\fR is being stripped
and returned.
.Sp
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 This operation is only allowed for structured header fields (which
are defined by the various RFCs as being so.  You don't want parts within
braces which are in the Subject header line to be removed, to give an
example.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBunfoldedBody\fR( [$body, [$wrap]] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBunfoldedBody\fR( [$body, [$wrap]] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->unfoldedBody( [$body, [$wrap]] )"
Returns the body as one single line, where all folding information (if
available) is removed.  This line will also \s-1NOT\s0 end on a new-line.
.Sp
The optional \f(CW$body\fR argument changes the field's body.  The right folding is
performed before assignment.  The \f(CW$wrap\fR may be specified to enforce a
folding size.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& my $body = $field\->unfoldedBody;
\& print "$field";   # via overloading

.IX Subsection "Access to the content"
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBaddresses\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBaddresses\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->addresses()"
Returns a list of Mail::Address objects, which represent the
e\-mail addresses found in this header line.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& my @addr = $message\->head\->get(\*(Aqto\*(Aq)\->addresses;
\& my @addr = $message\->to;
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBattribute\fR( $name, [$value] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBattribute\fR( \f(CW$name\fR, [$value] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->attribute( $name, [$value] )"
Get the value of an attribute, optionally after setting it to a new value.
Attributes are part of some header lines, and hide themselves in the
comment field.  If the attribute does not exist, then \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is
returned.  The attribute is still encoded.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& my $field = Mail::Message::Field\->new(
\&  \*(AqContent\-Type: text/plain; charset="us\-ascii"\*(Aq);
\&
\& print $field\->attribute(\*(Aqcharset\*(Aq);

\& $field\->print;
\&   # \-\-> Content\-Type: text/plain; charset="us\-ascii";
\&   #       filename="/tmp/xyz"
\&   # Automatically folded, and no doubles created.
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBattributes\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBattributes\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->attributes()"
Returns a list of key-value pairs, where the values are not yet decoded.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& my %attributes = $head\->get(\*(AqContent\-Disposition\*(Aq)\->attributes;
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBcomment\fR( [\s-1STRING\s0] )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBcomment\fR( [\s-1STRING\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "$obj->comment( [STRING] )"
Returns the unfolded comment (part after a semi-colon) in a structureed
header-line. optionally after setting it to a new \s-1STRING\s0 first.
When \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is specified as \s-1STRING\s0, the comment is removed.
Whether the field is structured is defined by \fIisStructured()\fR.
.Sp
The \fIcomment\fR part of a header field often contains \f(CW\*(C`attributes\*(C'\fR.  Often
it is preferred to use \fIattribute()\fR on them.
.ie n .IP "$obj\->\fBstudy\fR()" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBstudy\fR()" 4
.IX Item "$obj->study()"
Study the header field in detail: turn on the full parsing and detailed
understanding of the content of the fields.  Mail::Message::Field::Fast
and Mail::Message::Field::Fast objects will be transformed into any
Mail::Message::Field::Full object.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& my $subject = $msg\->head\->get(\*(Aqsubject\*(Aq)\->study;
\& my $subject = $msg\->head\->study(\*(Aqsubject\*(Aq);  # same

Convert a timestamp into an rfc2822 compliant date format.  This differs
from the default output of \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR in scalar context.  Without
argument, the \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR is used to get the current time. \f(CW$time\fR can
be specified as one numeric (like the result of \f(CW\*(C`time()\*(C'\fR) and as list

.SH "DETAILS"
.IX Header "DETAILS"
.SS "Field syntax"
.IX Subsection "Field syntax"
Fields are stored in the header of a message, which are represented by
Mail::Message::Head objects. A field is a combination of a \fIname\fR,
\&\fIbody\fR, and \fIattributes\fR.  Especially the term \*(L"body\*(R" is cause for
confusion: sometimes the attributes are considered to be part of the body.
.PP
The name of the field is followed by a colon ("\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR\*(L", not preceded by
blanks, but followed by one blank).  Each attribute is preceded by
a separate semi-colon (\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR").  Names of fields are case-insensitive and
cannot contain blanks.
.PP
\fIFolding fields\fR
.IX Subsection "Folding fields"
.PP
Fields which are long can be folded to span more than one line.  The real
limit for lines in messages is only at 998 characters, however such long
lines are not easy to read without support of an application.  Therefore
rfc2822 (which defines the message syntax) specifies explicitly that
field lines can be re-formatted into multiple sorter lines without change
of meaning, by adding new-line characters to any field before any blank or
tab.
.PP
Usually, the lines are reformatted to create lines which are 78 characters
maximum. Some applications try harder to fold on nice spots, like before
attributes.  Especially the \f(CW\*(C`Received\*(C'\fR field is often manually folded into
some nice layout.  In most cases however, it is preferred to produce lines
which are as long as possible but max 78.
.PP
\&\s-1BE\s0 \s-1WARNED\s0 that all fields can be subjected to folding, and that you usually
want the unfolded value.
.PP
\fIStructured fields\fR
.IX Subsection "Structured fields"
.PP
The rfc2822 describes a large number of header fields explicitly.  These
fields have a defined meaning.  For some of the fields, like the \f(CW\*(C`Subject\*(C'\fR
field, the meaning is straight forward the contents itself.  These fields
are the \fIUnstructured Fields\fR.
.PP
Other fields have a well defined internal syntax because their content is
needed by e\-mail applications. For instance, the \f(CW\*(C`To\*(C'\fR field contains
addresses which must be understood by all applications in the same way.
These are the \fIStructured Fields\fR, see \fIisStructured()\fR.
.PP
\fIComments in fields\fR
.IX Subsection "Comments in fields"
.PP
Stuctured fields can contain comments, which are pieces of text enclosed in
parenthesis.  These comments can be placed close to anywhere in the line
and must be ignored be the application.  Not all applications are capable
of handling comments correctly in all circumstances.
.SS "Getting a field"
.IX Subsection "Getting a field"
As many programs as there are handling e\-mail, as many variations on
accessing the header information are requested.  Be careful which way
you access the data: read the variations described here and decide
which solution suites your needs best.
.PP
\fIUsing \fIget()\fI field\fR
.IX Subsection "Using get() field"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`get()\*(C'\fR interface is copied from other Perl modules which can
handle e\-mail messages.  Many applications which simply replace
Mail::Internet objects by Mail::Message objects will work
without modification.
.PP
There is more than one get method.  The exact results depend on which
get you use.  When \fIMail::Message::get()\fR is called, you will get the
unfolded, stripped from comments, stripped from attributes contents of
the field as \fBstring\fR.  Character-set encodings will still be in the
string.  If the same fieldname appears more than once in the header,
only the last value is returned.
.PP
When \fIMail::Message::Head::get()\fR is called in scalar context, the
last field with the specified name is returned as field \fBobject\fR.
This object strinigfies into the unfolded contents of the field, including
attributes and comments.  In list context, all appearances of the field
in the header are returned as objects.
.PP
\&\s-1BE\s0 \s-1WARNED\s0 that some lines seem unique, but are not according to the
official rfc.  For instance, \f(CW\*(C`To\*(C'\fR fields can appear more than once.
If your program calls \f(CW\*(C`get(\*(Aqto\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR in scalar context, some information
is lost.
.PP
\fIUsing \fIstudy()\fI field\fR
.IX Subsection "Using study() field"
.PP
As the name \f(CW\*(C`study\*(C'\fR already implies, this way of accessing the fields is
much more thorough but also slower.  The \f(CW\*(C`study\*(C'\fR of a field is like a
\&\f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, but provides easy access to the content of the field and handles
character-set decoding correctly.
.PP
The \fIMail::Message::study()\fR method will only return the last field
with that name as object.  \fIMail::Message::Head::study()\fR and
\&\fIMail::Message::Field::study()\fR return all fields when used in list
context.
.PP
\fIUsing resent groups\fR
.IX Subsection "Using resent groups"
.PP
Some fields belong together in a group of fields.  For instance, a set
of lines is used to define one step in the mail transport process.  Each
step adds a \f(CW\*(C`Received\*(C'\fR line, and optionally some \f(CW\*(C`Resent\-*\*(C'\fR lines and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Return\-Path\*(C'\fR.  These groups of lines shall stay together and in order
when the message header is processed.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup\*(C'\fR object simplifies the access to
these related fields.  These resent groups can be deleted as a whole,
or correctly constructed.

Some fields are accessed that often that there are support methods to

.PP
\fISpecifying field data\fR
.IX Subsection "Specifying field data"
.PP
Field data can be anything, strongly dependent on the type
of field at hand. If you decide to contruct the fields very
carefully via some Mail::Message::Field::Full extension (like via
Mail::Message::Field::Addresses objects), then you will have protection
build-in.  However, you can bluntly create any Mail::Message::Field
object based on some data.
.PP
When you create a field, you may specify a string, object, or an array
of strings and objects.  On the moment, objects are only used to help
the construction on e\-mail addresses, however you may add some of your
own.
.PP
The following rules (implemented in \fIstringifyData()\fR) are obeyed given
the argument is:
.IP "\(bu" 4
a string
.Sp
The string must be following the (complicated) rules of the rfc2822, and
is made field content as specified.  When the string is not terminated
by a new-line (\f(CW"\en"\fR) it will be folded according to the standard rules.
.IP "\(bu" 4
a Mail::Address object
.Sp
The most used Perl object to parse and produce address lines.  This object
does not understand character set encodings in phrases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
a Mail::Identity object
.Sp
As part of the User::Identity distribution, this object has full
understanding of the meaning of one e\-mail address, related to a person.
All features defined by rfc2822 are implemented.
.IP "\(bu" 4
a User::Identity object
.Sp
A person is specified, which may have more than one Mail::Identity's
defined.  Some methods, like \fIMail::Message::reply()\fR and
\&\fIMail::Message::forward()\fR try to select the right e\-mail address
smart (see their method descriptions), but in other cases the first
e\-mail address found is used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
a User::Identity::Collection::Emails object
.Sp
All Mail::Identity objects in the collection will be included in
the field as a group carying the name of the collection.
.IP "\(bu" 4
any other object
.Sp
For all other objects, the stringification overload is used to produce
the field content.
.IP "\(bu" 4
an \s-1ARRAY\s0
.Sp
You may also specify an array with a mixture of any of the above.  The
elements will be joined as comma-separated list.  If you do not want
comma's inbetween, you will have to process the array yourself.
.SS "Field class implementation"
.IX Subsection "Field class implementation"
For performance reasons only, there are three types of fields: the
fast, the flexible, and the full understander:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Mail::Message::Field::Fast
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Fast\*(C'\fR objects are not derived from a \f(CW\*(C`Mail::Reporter\*(C'\fR.  The consideration
is that fields are so often created, and such a small objects at the same
time, that setting-up a logging for each of the objects is relatively
expensive and not really useful.
The fast field implementation uses an array to store the data: that
will be faster than using a hash.  Fast fields are not easily inheritable,
because the object creation and initiation is merged into one method.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Mail::Message::Field::Flex
.Sp
The flexible implementation uses a hash to store the data.  The \fInew()\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`init\*(C'\fR methods are split, so this object is extensible.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Mail::Message::Field::Full
.Sp
With a full implementation of all applicable RFCs (about 5), the best
understanding of the fields is reached.  However, this comes with
a serious memory and performance penalty.  These objects are created
from fast or flex header fields when \fIstudy()\fR is called.
