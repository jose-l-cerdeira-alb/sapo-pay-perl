.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This plugin intercepts \s-1HTTP\s0 requests to a Perlbal service and slows or drops
connections from \s-1IP\s0 addresses which are determined to be connecting too fast.
.SH "BEHAVIOR"
.IX Header "BEHAVIOR"
An \s-1IP\s0 address address may be in one of four states depending on its recent
activity; that state determines how new requests from the \s-1IP\s0 are handled:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBallowed\fR
.Sp
An \s-1IP\s0 begins in the \fBallowed\fR state. When a request is received from an \s-1IP\s0 in
this state, the request is handled immediately and the \s-1IP\s0 enters the
\&\fBprobation\fR state.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBprobation\fR
.Sp
If no requests are received from an \s-1IP\s0 in the \fBprobation\fR state for
\&\fIthrottle_threshold_seconds\fR, it returns to the \fBallowed\fR state.
.Sp
When a new request is received from an \s-1IP\s0 in the \fBprobation\fR state, the \s-1IP\s0
enters the \fBthrottled\fR state and is assigned a \fIdelay\fR property initially
equal to \fIinitial_delay\fR. Connection to a backend is postponed for \fIdelay\fR
seconds while perlbal continues to work. If the connection is still open after
the delay, the request is then handled normally. A dropped connection does not
change the \s-1IP\s0's \fIdelay\fR value.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBthrottled\fR
.Sp
If no requests are received from an \s-1IP\s0 in the \fBthrottled\fR state for
\&\fIdelay\fR seconds, it returns to the \fBprobation\fR state.
.Sp
When a new request is received from an \s-1IP\s0 in the \fBthrottled\fR state, its
\&\fIviolations\fR property is incremented, and its \fIdelay\fR property is
doubled (up to a maximum of \fImax_delay\fR). The request is postponed for the new
value of \fIdelay\fR.
.Sp
Only after the most recently created connection from a given \s-1IP\s0 exits the
\&\fBthrottled\fR state do \fIviolations\fR and \fIdelay\fR reset to 0.
.Sp
Furthermore, if the \fIviolations\fR exceeds \fIban_threshold\fR, the connection
is closed and the \s-1IP\s0 moves to the \fBbanned\fR state.
.Sp
IPs in the \fBthrottled\fR state may have no more than \fImax_concurrent\fR
connections being delayed at once. Any additional requests received in that
circumstance are sent a \*(L"503 Too many connections\*(R" response. Long-running
requests which have already been connected to a backend do not count towards
this limit.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBbanned\fR
.Sp
New connections from IPs in the banned state are immediately closed with a 403
error response.
.Sp
An \s-1IP\s0 leaves the \fBbanned\fR state after \fIban_expiration\fR seconds have
elapsed.
.SH "FEATURES"
.IX Header "FEATURES"
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1IP\s0 whitelist
.Sp
Connections from IPs/CIDRs listed in the file specified by \fIwhitelist_file\fR
are always allowed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1IP\s0 blacklist
.Sp
Connections from IPs/CIDRs listed in the file specified by \fIblacklist_file\fR
immediately sent a \*(L"403 Forbidden\*(R" response.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Flexible attack response
.Sp
For services where throttling should not normally be enabled, use the
\&\fIdefault_action\fR tunable. When \fIdefault_action\fR is set to \*(L"allow\*(R", new
connections from non\-white/blacklisted IPs will not be throttled.
.Sp
Furthermore, if throttling should only apply to specific clients, set
\&\fIblacklist_action\fR to \*(L"throttle\*(R". Blacklisted connections will then be
throttled instead of denied.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Dynamic configuration
.Sp
Most service tunables may be updated from the management port, after which the
new values will be respected (although see \*(L"\s-1CAVEATS\s0\*(R"). To reload the
whitelist and blacklist files, issue the \fIthrottle reload whitelist\fR or
\&\fIthrottle reload blacklist\fR command to the service.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Path specificity
.Sp
Throttling may be restricted to \s-1URI\s0 paths matching the \fIpath_regex\fR regex.
.IP "\(bu" 4
External shared state
.Sp
The plugin stores state which IPs have been seen in a \fImemcached\fR\|(1) instance.
This allows many throttlers to share their state and also minimizes memory use
within the perlbal. If state exceeds the capacity of the memcacheds, the
least-recently seen IPs will be forgotten, effectively resetting them to the
\&\fBallowed\fR state.
.Sp
Orthogonally, multiple throttlers which need to share memcacheds but not state
may specify distinct \fIinstance_name\fR values.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Logging
.Sp
If Perlbal::Plugin::Syslogger is installed and registered with the service,
Throttle can use it to send syslog messages regarding actions that are taken.
Granular control for which events are logged is available via the \fIlog_events\fR
parameter. \fIlog_events\fR is composed of one or more of the following events,
separated by commas:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
ban
.Sp
Log when a temporary local ban is added for an \s-1IP\s0 address.
.IP "\(bu" 4
unban
.Sp
Log when a temporary local ban is removed for an \s-1IP\s0 address.
.IP "\(bu" 4
whitelisted
.Sp
Log when a request is allowed because the source \s-1IP\s0 is on the whitelist.
.IP "\(bu" 4
blacklisted
.Sp
Log when a request is denied or throttled because the source \s-1IP\s0 is on the
blacklist.
.IP "\(bu" 4
banned
.Sp
Log when a request is denied because the source \s-1IP\s0 is on the temporary ban list
for connecting excessively.
.IP "\(bu" 4
concurrent
.Sp
Log when a request is denied because the source \s-1IP\s0 has too many open connections
waiting to be unthrottled.
.IP "\(bu" 4
throttled
.Sp
Log when a request is throttled because the source \s-1IP\s0 was not on the whitelist
or blacklist.
.IP "\(bu" 4
all
.Sp
Enables all the above logging options.
.IP "\(bu" 4
none
.Sp
Disables all the above logging options.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Dynamic configuration changes
.Sp
Changes to certain service tunables will not be noticed until the \fBthrottle
reload config\fR management command is issued. These include \fIlog_events\fR,
\&\fIpath_regex\fR, and \fImethod_regex\fR).
.Sp
Changes to certain other tunables will not be respected after the plugin has
been registered. These include \fImemcached_servers\fR and
\&\fImemcached_async_clients\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
List loading is blocking
.Sp
The \fIthrottle reload whitelist\fR and \fIthrottle reload blacklist\fR management
commands load the whitelist and blacklist files synchronously, which will cause
the perlbal to hang until it completes.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Redirects
.Sp
If a handled request returns a 30x response code and the redirect \s-1URI\s0 is also
throttled, then the client's attempt to follow the redirect will necessarily be
delayed by \fIinitial_delay\fR. Fixing this would require that the plugin inspect
the \s-1HTTP\s0 response headers, which would incur a lot of overhead. To workaround,
try to have your backend not return 30x's if both the original and redirect \s-1URI\s0
are proxied by the same throttler instance (yes, this is difficult for the case
where a backend 302s to add a trailing / to a directory).
