=head1 NAME

Mail::Message::Construct - extends the functionality of a Mail::Message

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # See Mail::Message

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Complex functionality on L<Mail::Message|Mail::Message> objects is implemented in
different files which are autoloaded.  This file implements the
functionality related to creating message replies.

The following constructors are available:

=over 4

=item Mail::Message::Construct::Bounce

=item Mail::Message::Construct::Build

=item Mail::Message::Construct::Forward

=item Mail::Message::Construct::Read

=item Mail::Message::Construct::Rebuild

=item Mail::Message::Construct::Reply

=item Mail::Message::Construct::Text

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<AUTOLOAD>()

When an unknown method is called on this message, this may mean that
not all code is compiled.  For performance reasons, most of the
complex activities on messages are dynamically loaded from other
packages.  An error will be produced when loading does not help resolving
the requested method.
