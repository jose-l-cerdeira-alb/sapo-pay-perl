Compiling the required transfer encoding resulted in errors, which means
that the decoder can not be used.

A decoder for the specified type of transfer encoding is not implemented.

=item Error: Package $package does not implement $method.

Fatal error: the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not
implement this method where it should. This message means that some other
related classes do implement this method however the class at hand does
not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author
of the package.
