=head1 NAME

  Text::Bloom - Evaluate Bloom signature of a set of terms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $b = Text::Bloom->new();
  $b->Compute( qw( foo bar baz ) );
  my $sig = $b->WriteToString();
  $b->WriteToFile( 'afile.sig' );
  my $b2 = Text::Bloom::NewFromFile( 'afile.sig' );
  my $b3 = Text::Bloom->new();
  $b3->Compute( qw( foo bar barbaz ) );
  my $sim = $b->Similarity( $b2 );
  my $b4 = Text::Bloom::NewFromString( $sig );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Text::Bloom> applies the Bloom filtering technique to
the statistical analysis of documents.

The terms in the document are quantized using a base-36
radix representation; each term thus corresponds to an
integer in the range 0..I<p-1>, where I<p> is a prime,
currently set to the greatest prime less than 2^32.

Each quantized value is mapped to I<d> integers in the range
0..I<size-1>, where I<size> is an integer less than I<p>,
currently 2^17, using a  family of hash functions,
computed by the C<HashV> function.

Each hashed value is used as the index in a large bit vector.
Bits corresponding to terms present in the document are set to
1; all other bits are set to 0.

Of course, collisions may cause the same bit to be set twice,
by different terms. It follows that, if the document contains
I<n> distinct terms, in the resulting bit vector at most
I<n * d> bits are set to 1.

The resulting bit string is a very compact representation of the
presence/absence of terms in the document, and  is therefore
characterised as a I<signature>. Moreover, it does not
depend on a pre-set dictionary of terms.

The signature may be used for:

=over 4

=item *

testing whether a given set of terms is present in the document,

=item *

computing which fraction of terms are common to two documents.

=back

The bit representation may be written to and read from a file.
C<Text::Bloom> prepends a header to the bit stream proper;
moreover, whenever the package C<Compress::Zlib> is available,
the bit vector is compressed, so that disk space requirements
are drastically reduced, especially for small documents.

The hash function is obviously a crucial component of the filter;
the reference implementation uses a radix representation of
strings. Each term must therefore match the regular
expression C</[0-9a-z]+/>.

There are quite a few viable alternatives, which can be pursued
by subclassing and redefining the method C<QuantizeV>.

=head1 FORESEEN REUSE

The package may be {re}used either by simple instantiation,
or by subclassing (defining a descendant package).  In the
latter case the methods which are foreseen to be redefined are
those ending with a C<V> suffix.  Redefining other methods
will require greater attention.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor. No arguments are required.

  $b = Text::Bloom->new();

=head2 NewFromString

Take a string written by C<WriteToString> (see below)
and create a new C<Text::Bloom> with the same contents;
call C<die> whenever the restore is impossible or ill-advised,
for instance when the current version of the package is different
from the original one, or the compression library in unavailable.

  my $b = Text::Bloom::NewFromString( $str );

The return value is a blessed reference; put in another way,
this is an alternative contructor.

The string should have been written by C<WriteToString>; 
you may of course tweak the string contents, but
at this point you're entirely on you own.

=head2 NewFromFile

Utility function that reads a binary file and performs a C<NewFromString>
on its content; see its counterpart, C<WriteToFile>.

  my $b2 = Text::Document::NewFromFile( 'foo.sig' );

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 Size

Set and get the size of the filter, in bits. The default size
is currently 128K.

  print 'size is ' . $b->Size() . "\n";
  $b->Size( 65536 );

The C<Size> method must be called before the C<Compute> method
in order to have effect.

=head2 Compute

Compute the Bloom signature from the given set of words
and store it internally.

  $b->Compute( qw( foo bar baz foobar bazbaz ) );

Makes use of the C<QuantizeV> method.

=head2 QuantizeV

Convert a term into an integer; must return
an integer in the range 0 .. C<$Text::Bloom::p-1>.

It is called as

  my $hash = $b->QuantizeV( $term );

The current version is designed for strings matching
C</[a-z0-9]+/>. Other characters do not cause errors,
but degrade the hash function performance.

This function is a likely candidate for redefinition.

=head2 HashV

Convert an integer to a (smaller) integer, according
to one of a class of similar functions.

It is internally called as:

  my $index = $b->HashV( $order, $value );

The C<$value> must belong  to the  interval
0..C<$Text::Bloom::p-1>, while the index  must
lie in 0..I<size-1>. C<$order> is
a small integer from 0 to I<d-1>.

The default implementation is

  index = m[order] * value + q[order]   (mod size) 

the values of I<m> and I<q> are taken from the array
C<@Text::Bloom::hashParam>; the form of the  function
is taken from [2].

=head2 WriteToString

Convert the Bloom signature into a string which can be saved and
later restored with C<NewFromString>. C<Compute> must have
been called previously.

  my $str = $b->WriteToString();

The string begins with a header which encodes the
originating package, its version, the parameters
of the current instance.

Whenever possible, C<Compress::Zlib> is used in order to
compress the bit vector in the most efficient way.
On systems without C<Compress::Zlib>, the bit string is
saved uncompressed.

=head2 WriteToFile

These convenience functions just call their String counterparts
and read/write the file specified in the argument.

  $b->WriteToFile( 'foo.sig' );

=head1 BUGS

On Win32 we have experienced some instabilities when dealing
with a large number of signatures; in this case Perl crashes
without apparent explanation. The main suspect is  Bit::Vector,
but without any evidence.
